This sequence is based on four distinct steps, where each expert provided one piece of the solution:

- Expert 1 identified the need for a MySQL deployment and defined an appropriate manifest.
- Expert 2 provided the accompanying service configuration for MySQL.
- Expert 3 outlined how to set up WordPress as a deployment effectively integrating it with MySQL.
- Finally, Expert 4 crafted the service definition that exposes WordPress to the internet via a LoadBalancer. 

All experts contribute towards a complete setup for deploying WordPress and MySQL on Kubernetes, maintaining a straightforward and collaborative approach throughout the process. These YAML manifests reflect this progressive input method and can be used in sequence to deploy a full WordPress site with a MySQL backend on a Kubernetes cluster.
