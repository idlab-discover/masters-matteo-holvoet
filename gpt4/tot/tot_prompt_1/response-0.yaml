### Step 1: Define Objects and Basic Configuration

**Expert 1:**  
"First, we specify the kind of Kubernetes objects we need for deploying WordPress with a MySQL backend. Clearly, we'll need Deployments and Services for wordpress and mysql."

**Expert 2:**  
"I also suggest setting labels properly to ensure that services link with the correct deployments. Labels can manage connections between services and pods."

**Expert 3:**  
"I agree and would add that each Deployment will manage a Pod which contains the respective containers - 'wordpress' for the WordPress instance and 'mysql' for the MySQL instance."

### Step 2: Define MySQL Details

**Expert 1:**  
"Let's define the MySQL deployment. It will need environment variables for credentials like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, and we could use a ConfigMap or secrets to manage these securely."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  mysql-root-password: bXlzcWxzZWNyZXRwYXNzd29yZA==  # Encoded 'mysqlsecretpassword'

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: mysql-root-password
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        emptyDir: {}
```

**Expert 2:**  
"For the MySQL service, weâ€™ll expose it within the cluster but not externally to keep it secure. It will use the default MySQL port 3306."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```

**Expert 3:**  
"Good setup. We should examine storage options too. For now, using `emptyDir` for conceptual purposes, but moving forward we might consider PersistentVolumes for data persistence beyond pod lifecycle."

### Step 3: Define WordPress Details

**Expert 1:**  
"Now onto the WordPress deployment. It will also need environment settings to connect to the MySQL database, utilizing the service name as the host."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql:3306
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: mysql-root-password
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-storage
        emptyDir: {}
```

**Expert 2:**  
"We also need a WordPress service, exposed on a public port so users can access the website. I recommend using port 80 for HTTP traffic."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

**Expert 3:**  
"Looks solid! Also, consider that both deployments could benefit from volume claims for production. For this exercise, `emptyDir` covers functionality."

### Summary

All steps have been implemented and reviewed by the three experts, and no exiting was necessary as no major errors were identified. Each step was focused on incrementally building the necessary Kubernetes YAML configurations for deploying WordPress with MySQL, ensuring connectivity and security through the use of ConfigMaps, Secrets, and proper service definitions.
