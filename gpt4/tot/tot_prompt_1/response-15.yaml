Here is the step-by-step process each expert might follow to create a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database:

### Expert 1

**Step 1:** Define the MySQL Deployment
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
```
_Thought Process_: Start by setting up the database backend. Use a Recreate strategy to avoid issues with persistent connections during pod recreation.

### Expert 2

**Step 1:** Begin with the MySQL Persistent Volume Claim
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```
_Thought Process_: Persistent data storage is crucial for the database to ensure data is not lost when the pod restarts.

### Expert 3

**Step 1:** Define the WordPress Deployment
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
```
_Thought Process_: Set up the WordPress container pointing to the MySQL server for the database, configuring environment variables for database access.

### Step 2 Discussion and Continuation

**Expert 1 & 2 realizations**: They realize the necessity of referring to a PVC in the MySQL Deployment, adjusting to include volume mounts, which Expert 2 provides. They also realize the need to define a Service for MySQL for network access, as indicated by Expert 3's use of `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST`.

**Expert 3 realization**: Recognizes the need for persistent storage and network services for both WordPress and MySQL, influences the continuation of defining Services.

All experts continue, harmonizing their steps based on these cross-understandings.
