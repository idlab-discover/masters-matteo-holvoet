### Expert 1: Kubernetes Infrastructure Specialist

**Step 1: Creation of MySQL Deployment**
- To begin, I would focus on setting up the MySQL database since it is the backbone for storing WordPress data. The deployment should include a Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim to ensure the data persists across pod recreations. 
- I will then configure a Kubernetes Deployment and a Service for MySQL to guarantee that the deployment is managed properly for scalability and that it is reachable within the cluster.

**Step 2: Creation of WordPress Deployment**
- After ensuring that the MySQL server is set up and operational, I would proceed with the WordPress deployment. 
- This deployment would also require a Persistent Volume Claim to handle media storage.
- Configuring a Kubernetes Deployment with a Service for WordPress would be necessary, and this service should be exposed externally since it needs to be accessible from the internet.

**Step 3: Configuration and Environment Variables**
- Finally, configuring the environment variables in both deployments is critical. WordPress needs the database name, user, and password to connect to MySQL.
- I would utilize Kubernetes secrets to manage these sensitive data securely.

```yaml

### Expert Analysis of Kubernetes Infrastructure Specialist's Approach:

**Expert Scoring**

- **Expert 2 (Kubernetes Security Specialist):** 4/5
  - The approach is solid in terms of functional deployment. However, the security context for the MySQL and WordPress containers could have been defined to enhance the security aspect.

- **Expert 3 (Kubernetes Network Specialist):** 5/5
  - The infrastructure setup is coherent with Kubernetes best practices. The use of internal cluster IP for MySQL and LoadBalancer for WordPress is efficiently planned.

**Overall Assessment**
- Given that the methodology was functional and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive, this YAML is a potent consensus solution for deploying a WordPress site with a MySQL backend in Kubernetes.
