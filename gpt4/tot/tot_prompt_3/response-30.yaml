To effectively address the task of creating Kubernetes YAML manifests to deploy a WordPress website using a MySQL database, let's simulate the think-aloud process and peer review among three experts in Kubernetes configuration: a Kubernetes Architect, a DevOps Engineer, and a Cloud Solutions Architect.

### Step 1: Initialization of MySQL Database Deployment

#### Kubernetes Architect:
We begin by creating a Deployment for MySQL. We need a container named "mysql", which will run the MySQL image. We'll use a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to ensure data persistence across pod recreations. The deployment must have environment variables for MySQL like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD for security.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: mypassword
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

#### DevOps Engineer:
We require a MySQL instance with proper storage and security settings. The password for MySQL should be stored using Kubernetes secrets rather that directly in the deployment manifest. We need to create a persistent volume claim and a secret before this deployment.

#### Cloud Solutions Architect:
The MySQL deployment should also focus on resilience. We may want to consider options like configuring readiness and liveness probes to ensure that the MySQL service is healthy and operational before it starts serving traffic.

### Peer Review Scores:
1. **Kubernetes Architect:** 4 - Detailed and practical approach, but lacks security best practices.
2. **DevOps Engineer:** 4 - Correct about using secrets, but hasn’t provided a complete manifest.
3. **Cloud Solutions Architect:** 3 - Good additional points on resilience, but no concrete YAML manifest provided.

### Step 2: Deployment of WordPress

#### Kubernetes Architect:
For deploying WordPress, a similar approach as MySQL will be used, focusing on a Deployment with references to necessary secrets and config data. We need to set up WordPress to communicate with the MySQL database using environment variables.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-password
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pvc
```

#### DevOps Engineer:
Integrating with the suggestion for secure management of passwords using secrets, the WordPress configuration will include environment variables set to fetch values from these secrets. Additionally, configuring a Service for WordPress to make it accessible.

#### Cloud Solutions Architect:
Agreed on security and persistence for WordPress but it’s also vital to expose the WordPress service using Kubernetes Services so that it can be consumed.

### Peer Review Scores:
1. **Kubernetes Architect:** 5 - The YAML is complete and integrates properly with the MySQL deployment.
2. **DevOps Engineer:** 5 - Good insights on deployment security and how to make the application accessible.
3. **Cloud Solutions Architect:** 4 - Points out important requirements but lacks detail in the implementation.

### Summary and Final Solution:
The consensus indicates that a combined approach of the Kubernetes Architect and DevOps Engineer provides the most robust and practical solution to deploy WordPress with MySQL on Kubernetes, with emphasis on security (utilizing secrets) and resilience. The Cloud Solutions Architect inputs are valuable for operational readiness and durability, but they would benefit from more implementation detail.

**Best Guess Solution:** Merge Kubernetes Architect's detailed manifests with security practices highlighted by the DevOps Engineer, including Kubernetes Secrets and Services for full functionality and secure, accessible deployment.
