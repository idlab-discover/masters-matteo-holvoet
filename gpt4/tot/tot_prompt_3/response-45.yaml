To perform this scenario where each expert will sequentially outline steps to create a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website using MySQL as the backend, we need to clearly define these steps in collaboration. Each expert will provide a process or part of the Kubernetes YAML according to their specialization. Here I will simulate the process among three types of experts: a Kubernetes Architect, a Database Administrator (DBA), and a DevOps Engineer. Each will contribute their expertise.

### Step 1: Define the Kubernetes Deployment for WordPress
#### Kubernetes Architect:
The initial step involves setting up the deployment configuration for WordPress. This should include defining a suitable Docker image (e.g., WordPress latest), setting the required environment variables for database connections, and specifying the container name as "wordpress". We need to ensure resource requests and limits are set for optimal performance.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: wordpressuser
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
          limits:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: "1"
```

#### Database Administrator (DBA):
I agree with the Kubernetes Architect on defining the deployment but would emphasize the security of database credentials using Kubernetes Secrets. The password should not be hard-coded or exposed, and a readiness probe should be added to ensure the MySQL database is ready to accept connections before starting the WordPress service.

#### DevOps Engineer:
The deployment setup described is adequate for starters but lacks specifications on volumes for persistent data storage for WordPress. For a production-level setup, it's critical to include persistent volume claims (PVCs) to ensure data is not lost when pods are restarted or rescheduled. Additionally, a health check (liveness probe and readiness probe) should also be included for better management.

**Scoring:**
- **Kubernetes Architect:** 4 - Good initial setup, missing details on persistence and health checks.
- **Database Administrator:** 4 - Valid security concern, missing practical implementation details.
- **DevOps Engineer:** 5 - Completeness in addressing both persistence and health checks.

### Step 2: Define the Kubernetes Deployment and Service for MySQL
#### Kubernetes Architect:
For the MySQL part, itâ€™s essential to set up another deployment with environment variables for the MySQL root password and database user credentials. Additionally, setting a MySQL image and defining a persistent volume claim for database storage would be crucial. Here's how it can be set:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: wordpressuser
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

#### Database Administrator:
The setup described by the Kubernetes Architect correctly covers the deployment needs for MySQL with environments set properly. However, I would insist on more robust data handling strategies, integrity checks, and potentially setting up a database cluster for failover capabilities should also be discussed.

#### DevOps Engineer:
The Kubernetes Architect nailed the deployment for MySQL. The inclusion of persistent volumes is crucial. However, a MySQL Service needs to be defined to allow communication with the WordPress application. Here is an example of a simple ClusterIP service which would enable WordPress to communicate with MySQL over the internal network.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
```

**Scoring:**
- **Kubernetes Architect:** 5 - Detailed and functional MySQL deployment setup.
- **Database Administrator:** 3 - More focus on advanced database management rather than deployment setup.
- **DevOps Engineer:** 5 - Critical implementation of the service which enables network connectivity.

### Final Analysis
Based on the expertise contributions, consensus among these steps provided by our three experts, and scoring each other's responses, we can integrate all proposed solutions into a coherent deployment setup. Each expert brings a crucial part of the deployment strategy that when combined, results in a robust, secure, and scalable Kubernetes deployment for WordPress and MySQL.

We would proceed with the composition of all these inputs into integrated YAML manifests incorporating deployment configurations, services, volumes, and security practices as highlighted by our experts.
