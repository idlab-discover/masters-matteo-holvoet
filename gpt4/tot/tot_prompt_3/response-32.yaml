### Step 1: Draft Initial YAML For MySQL Deployment

#### Expert 1: Kubernetes DevOps Expert
**Thinking:** To set up a MySQL database for WordPress, we need a Deployment and a corresponding Service in Kubernetes. The YAML should specify the MySQL container, environment variables such as MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_USER, and MYSQL_PASSWORD for database access. PersistentVolume should be used to ensure data persistence.

**Draft:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
```

#### Expert 2: Database Administrator
**Thinking:** The setup should include proper security practices with secret management, not plaintext passwords in the Deployment. Additionally, we need to consider scalability by planning the database replication and partitioning, though this is not detailed in the YAML.

**Draft:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: admin
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: user-password
```

#### Expert 3: Cloud Solutions Architect
**Thinking:** The initial deployment should be simple and straightforward, focusing on getting a WordPress site up and running quickly. We should ensure that we define resources and limits to optimize usage in a cloud environment and maybe use a managed service if the environment allows.

**Draft:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "500Mi"
            cpu: "0.5"
          limits:
            memory: "1000Mi"
            cpu: "1"
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: wordpressuser
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value: wordpresspass
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-data
        emptyDir: {}
```

**Scoring of Responses:**
- Expert 1 scores Expert 2 at 4 for security but lacks a complete YAML definition.
- Expert 1 scores Expert 3 at 3, noting a good use of resources but missing persistent storage.
- Expert 2 scores Expert 1 at 3 for detail but criticizes plaintext passwords.
- Expert 2 scores Expert 3 at 3 for simplicity and resource definitions but notes the lack of security practices.
- Expert 3 scores Expert 1 at 4 for a complete setup but notes potential security improvements.
- Expert 3 scores Expert 2 at 4 due to security practices but lacks full-service definition. 

**Agreed upon step:** The group consensus leans towards a combination of Expert 1 and Expert 2's drafts, incorporating both detailed configurations and security improvements.
