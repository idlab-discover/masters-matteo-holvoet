### Expert 1: Kubernetes DevOps Specialist

**Step 1: Understanding the Components** 
- WordPress requires a PHP server and a MySQL database. 
- Two separate containers will be necessary: one for MySQL and one for WordPress.

**My thinking**: We can use the official WordPress and MySQL Docker images. WordPress will need environment variables to connect to MySQL.

**Step 2: Define the MySQL Deployment and Service**
- MySQL will be deployed with its specific service to expose the database internally.

**My thinking**: Use a Kubernetes Deployment for MySQL. A corresponding Service will ensure that the MySQL instance is reachable by the WordPress instance through DNS.

**Step 3: Define the WordPress Deployment and Service**
- WordPress will be deployed using another Kubernetes Deployment.
- It must communicate internally with the MySQL service and be exposed externally to receive traffic.

**My thinking**: Define a Service for WordPress, typically of type LoadBalancer, to expose it over the internet.


### Expert 2: Kubernetes Solutions Architect

**Step 1: Define the requirements**
- Both applications will run in containers; MySQL and WordPress must communicate over a network.

**My thinking**: This setup requires persistent storage for MySQL to ensure data is not lost.

**Step 2: Create a PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for MySQL**
- This ensures MySQL data persists across pod recreations.

**My thinking**: Using PVC allows Kubernetes to manage the disk provisioning automatically when deployed in a cloud provider or when dynamic provisioning is configured.

**Step 3: Create Deployments and Services**
- WordPress and MySQL will have separate deployments and services.

**My thinking**: The link between WordPress and MySQL will be facilitated via Kubernetes services, utilizing internal DNS for service discovery.


### Expert 3: Cloud Infrastructure Engineer

**Step 1: Choose appropriate images**
- Selection of Docker images for the deployment of WordPress and MySQL.

**My thinking**: Image selection is critical for security and compatibility; verified official images should be used.

**Step 2: Define Deployment configurations**
- Focus on the configuration aspects like environment variables, volumes, and resource constraints.

**My thinking**: Proper configuration is essential for operational efficiency and resiliency. ConfigMaps or Secrets may be needed for sensitive data.

**Step 3: Network and exposure configuration**
- Setup internal networking for MySQL and external access for WordPress.

**My thinking**: Kubernetes networking must be effectively set up to ensure secure and efficient operation, with a robust ingress setup for WordPress if necessary.

**Analysis and Consensus:**
- All experts agree on deploying WordPress and MySQL as separate services with persistent storage for MySQL and environment variable configuration.
- Key considerations include security, persistence, container image selection, and network communication setup.
- Their scoring and responses would likely rate highly across the board as all focus on crucial aspects of a robust Kubernetes deployment. Their collective insights inform the final Kubernetes YAML manifest.
