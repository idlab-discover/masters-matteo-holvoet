### Expert 1: Kubernetes Infrastructure Specialist

#### Step 1: Define Basic Structure
Thinking about deploying WordPress with MySQL in Kubernetes involves creating Deployment and Service objects for each. The WordPress container will connect to the MySQL container via a service within the cluster.

**Response:**
- Define a PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for both WordPress and MySQL to ensure data persistence.
- Create a MySQL Deployment using a Docker MySQL image. Set up environment variables for the MySQL root password, database, and user.
- Establish a Kubernetes Service for MySQL to allow communication within the cluster.
- Set up a WordPress Deployment with environment variables pointing to the MySQL database.
- Configure a Kubernetes Service for WordPress to expose it to the internet.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: mysql:5.7
        name: mysql
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: wordpress:latest
        name: wordpress
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: wordpress
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: wordpress
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pv-claim

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

This step ensures that we have proper persistence and basic service discovery implemented within the cluster, setting the stage for actual application deployment.

**Scoring:**
- The reasoning and setup are sound and follow Kubernetes best practices. The manifest properly defines PVs, PVCs, deployments with appropriate configurations, and services to expose WordPress externally and MySQL internally.

### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

#### Step 1: Illustrate Deployment Strategy
When deploying applications like WordPress and MySQL in Kubernetes, one needs to manage both availability and data integrity with appropriate strategies.

**Response:**
- Define roll-out and roll-back strategies for each deployment (not entirely shown in YAML).
- Implement health checks (readiness and liveness probes) to ensure services are always available and responsive.
- Configure Resource limits and requests to ensure efficient resource usage in the cluster.

```yaml
# Adjustments and additions to the initial manifest provided by Expert 1:

kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: "500m"
              memory: "512Mi"
            requests:
              cpu: "250m"
              memory: "256Mi"
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /wp-admin/install.php
              port: 80
            initialDelaySeconds: 60
            periodSeconds: 10
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /wp-admin/install.php
              port: 80
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            timeoutSeconds: 5

# Note: Similar configurations should be replicated for MySQL where applicable.
```

**Scoring:**
- The strategy helps in maintaining the integrity and availability of services. Resource limits prevent one service from consuming resources at the expense of another, while health checks ensure only healthy pods are in service.

### Expert 3: Cloud Architect

#### Step 1: Security and Network Setup
Securing applications and configuring precise network settings are vital for reliable Kubernetes deployments, especially for databases like MySQL and public-facing applications like WordPress.

**Response:**
- Implement network policies to restrict traffic between services.
- Use Kubernetes Secrets for managing sensitive data like database passwords.
- Configure more secure storage options, if available.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: mysql-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: wordpress
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306

kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ= # Base64 encoded
...
  containers:
  - name: mysql
    env:
    - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: mysql-secret
          key: password
```

**Scoring:**
- Introducing network policies and secrets for secure connections and management of sensitive data enhances security, which is crucial in production environments.
