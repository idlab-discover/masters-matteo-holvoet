**Step 1: Initialize Deployment and Services for MySQL**

```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306

---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
```

**Thinking**: Deployment handles creating and scaling the MySQL container. Environment variables are set to configure MySQL credentials. The service part exposes MySQL on port 3306 within the cluster.

**Step 2: Initialize Deployment and Services for WordPress**

```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

**Thinking**: WordPress configuration includes specifying the MySQL host and credentials to ensure connectivity. A LoadBalancer service type is used to distribute incoming traffic to the WordPress pods.

## Expert 2: DevOps Engineer
**Step 1: Crafting MySQL Components**

Similar definition as Expert 1, with additional emphasis on using ConfigMaps for MYSQL passwords for enhanced security and maintenance simplicity. Proposed scoring Expert 1 with a 4, due to the use of plaintext passwords.

**Step 2: Crafting WordPress Components**

Also similar definition but suggests using PersistentVolume to ensure data persistence for WordPress content.

## Expert 3: Cloud Architect
**Step 1: Defining MySQL Service and Deployment**

Broadly in agreement with other experts but recommended using a StatefulSet instead of a Deployment for MySQL to ensure stable network identifiers.

**Step 2: Defining WordPress Service and Deployment**

Concur with others but stressed more on the scalability aspect by recommending a scalable deployment strategy.

### Analysis and Consensus Decision:
- **MySQL Setup**: Majority agreement on using a Deployment, though a StatefulSet may offer more stable network IDs advised by Expert 3. Using a Service with no external IP (`ClusterIP: None`) for tighter security as recommended sounds prudent.
- **WordPress Setup**: Consensus on using a Deployment and LoadBalancer type service. Notable enhancements include integrating PersistentVolumes for data persistence and possibly integrating security and scaling practices.

Best guess solution would integrate insights from each expert to leverage both security and scalability while maintaining simplicity in the implementation.
