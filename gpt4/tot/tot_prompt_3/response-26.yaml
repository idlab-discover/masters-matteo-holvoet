### Step 1: Initial YAML Structure for Deployment

**Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect**
- **Analysis**: To deploy both WordPress and MySQL on Kubernetes, we'll start with defining the YAML files for each. We need two Deployment resources and two Service resources. The MySQL database should have its own persistent storage to maintain data across Pod restarts, and WordPress should be able to communicate with MySQL through a Service.
- **Thought Process**: Start by creating separate Deployment and Service manifests for each component.
- **YAML Sketch**:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: mysql
    name: mysql
  ...
  ```
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: mysql-service
  ...
  ```

**Expert 2: DevOps Engineer**
- **Analysis**: Agrees with Expert 1 about setting up separate deployments and services. Points out the need for environment variables in the WordPress deployment to connect to MySQL, using the service name as the MySQL host.
- **Thought Process**: Focus on connectivity and data security, and ensure that WordPress has the correct credentials and environment settings to connect to MySQL.
- **YAML Sketch**:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: wordpress
    name: wordpress
  ...
  ```
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: wordpress-service
  ...
  ```

**Expert 3: Database Administrator**
- **Analysis**: Concentrates on the MySQL setup, advocating for the use of a PersistentVolumeClaim to ensure data persistence. Suggests specific settings for MySQL like character encoding.
- **Thought Process**: Priority on database security and persistent data management.
- **YAML Sketch**:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: mysql-pvc
  ...
  ```
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: mysql-deployment
  ...
  ```

### Peer Scoring
- **Expert 1 scores**: 
  - Expert 2: 5 (Agrees on the separation and focus on connectivity)
  - Expert 3: 5 (Recognizes the importance of data persistence)

- **Expert 2 scores**:
  - Expert 1: 5 (Proper initial setup direction)
  - Expert 3: 4 (Good focus on persistence but lacks complete deployment details)

- **Expert 3 scores**:
  - Expert 1: 5 (Clear structured approach on deployments/service)
  - Expert 2: 4 (Connection settings are crucial, good addition)

### Step 2: Integration and Specific Configuration Details

**Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect**
- **Further Analysis**: Proposes configuring a Secret to store MySQL credentials and using these in the MySQL and WordPress Deployments.
- **Deeper Thought Process**: Security of credentials and ease of configuration management.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: mysql-secret
  type: Opaque
  data:
    mysql-password: <base64-encoded-password>
  ...
  ```

**Expert 2: DevOps Engineer**
- **Further Analysis**: Suggests enabling a readiness and liveness probes for both deployments to ensure they are healthy and ready to serve traffic.
- **Deeper Thought Process**: Operational stability and automated recovery.
  ```yaml
  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /
      port: 80
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /
      port: 80
  ...
  ```

**Expert 3: Database Administrator**
- **Further Analysis**: Recommends tuning MySQL configuration for better performance and setting resource requests and limits.
- **Deeper Thought Process**: Operational efficiency and resource management.
  ```yaml
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "256Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
  ...
  ```

### Peer Scoring (Round 2)
- **Expert 1 scores**: 
  - Expert 2: 5 (Crucial for service reliability)
  - Expert 3: 5 (Important for DB performance and resource containment)

- **Expert 2 scores**:
  - Expert 1: 5 (Essential security practices)
  - Expert 3: 5 (Effective resource management)

- **Expert 3 scores**:
  - Expert 1: 5 (Security is paramount)
  - Expert 2: 5 (Operational stability is key)

### Conclusion based on Analysis
- All experts agree to incorporate security, performance, and connectivity into the Kubernetes deployment manifests for WordPress and MySQL.
- The consensus is to include data persistence, security practices, resource management, and health checks to ensure a robust deployment.
- The detailed YAML manifests would incorporate these settings along with specific configurations suggested by each expert, forming a solid basis for deploying the WordPress website with MySQL on Kubernetes.
