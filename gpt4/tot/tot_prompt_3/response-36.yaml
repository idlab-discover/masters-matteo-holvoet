### Step 1: Define the Kubernetes Deployment and Service for MySQL

**Expert 1: Kubernetes Infrastructure Architect**
- **Description of Step**: 
  To begin, we will first define the MySQL deployment. We need a MySQL container running as a part of a Kubernetes Deployment. This setup will include defining the necessary volume for data persistence and also creating a Kubernetes Service to expose the MySQL instance internally.
- **Thinking**: MySQL will require a persistent volume to ensure data persistence across pod restarts. Using a Deployment ensures that a desired number of replicas of MySQL are maintained. The Service will be ClusterIP type to allow communication from within the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            value: # Add a root password here 
          - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
            value: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
```

**Expert 2: Kubernetes Application Developer**
- **Description of Step**:
  To configure the backend database, the MySQL service is vital. Starting with a Deployment managing the lifecycle of the MySQL pods is crucial. Ensuring that configuration details such as the MySQL version and environmental variables (like passwords and database user information) are correct ensures smooth operation of services.
- **Thinking**: Configurations like the root password and database username will be stored in environment variables within the pod definition. The use of PVC ensures that any data stored in the database remains secure even if the pod crashes.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

**Expert 3: DevOps Engineer**
- **Description of Step**:
  Establishment of a MySQL database deployment includes setting up a deployment, a persistent volume claim, and a corresponding service. The use of environment variables for MYSQL root password and database names facilitates easy changes and possible configurations through CI/CD pipelines.
- **Thinking**: The configuration focuses on security and efficiency, highlighting the importance of environment variables for sensitive information and utilizing PVC for data durability.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
          - containerPort: 3306
        env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-secret
                key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-pv-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-pv-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
```
