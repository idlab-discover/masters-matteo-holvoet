#### Step 1: Defining the MySQL Deployment

**Thinking:**
For a WordPress website, MySQL serves as the backend database. I would start by creating a MySQL deployment with a persistent volume to ensure data persistence across pod restarts.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: rootpassword
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: wordpressuser
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value: wordpresspassword
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

#### Step 2: Defining the MySQL Service

**Thinking:**
To allow communication between WordPress and MySQL, a service for MySQL needs to be defined to expose MySQL pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
```

### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

#### Step 1: Defining the MySQL Deployment

**Thinking:**
MySQL as the backbone for WordPress needs a careful configuration, especially focused on security and performance settings. But initially, setting up a basic deployment for MySQL with a secure setup of passwords and a persistent volume for data is critical.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: wordpressuser
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: user-password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

#### Step 2: Defining the MySQL Service

**Thinking:**
Ensuring that the MySQL database is accessible to only the WordPress pods, not exposed externally. Using a Kubernetes Service of type ClusterIP (default) ensures internal access.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```

### Expert 3: Cloud Architect

#### Step 1: Defining the MySQL Deployment

**Thinking:**
Setting up MySQL with consideration for high availability and resilience might involve configurations for replication, but the immediate need is to establish a reliable single instance with secure access and persistence.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        args: ["--default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password"]
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: examplepassword
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

#### Step 2: Defining the MySQL Service

**Thinking:**
MySQL service should be robust and carefully scoped to allow connections only from the necessary WordPress pods within the cluster. Specifying `ClusterIP` explicitly can also be a way to document the intent clearly.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```

### Analysis and Best Guess Solution

All three experts have provided valid and closely aligned steps in defining the MySQL deployment and service for a WordPress application. There's agreement on the general approach with some variations in handling secrets and specifics of MySQL configuration.

**Consensus Solution:**
- Deployment using `mysql:5.7` image with an emphasis on security via environmental variables or secrets.
- Persistent volume claim to ensure data persistence.
- MySQL service defined as `ClusterIP` to restrict access within the cluster.

Given the similar level of expertise across the answers (differing in details like password management via Kubernetes secrets), the Expert 2's approach with using secrets is slightly more secure than simply environmental variables, making it the preferred detailed methodology for this scenario.
