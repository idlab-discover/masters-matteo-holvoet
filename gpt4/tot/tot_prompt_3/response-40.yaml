Certainly! We will simulate a discussion among three experts in Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure to generate an accurate Kubernetes YAML manifest for a WordPress website using a MySQL database. 

### Expert A: Kubernetes Specialist
**Step 1**: Suggest the basic components required.
- A Deployment for WordPress connected to a MySQL service.
- A Deployment for MySQL.
- PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) for persistent storage for MySQL.
- A Kubernetes Service to expose the WordPress deployment.
- Thinking: High availability and data persistence are mandatory for production environments.

**Score for Step 1**: N/A (Self-evaluation not required)

### Expert B: DevOps Engineer
**Step 1**: Outline the steps for integrating components.
- Use environment variables within the WordPress Deployment to link to the MySQL Service.
- Mount a PersistentVolume into the MySQL deployment for data safety.
- Create a LoadBalancer type Service for WordPress to be accessible over the internet.
- Thinking: Ease of deployment and management through CI/CD should be emphasized.

**Score for Step 1**: N/A (Self-evaluation not required)

### Expert C: Cloud Architect
**Step 1**: Focus on security and scalability.
- Propose the use of ConfigMaps or Secrets to manage database credentials.
- Consider auto-scaling for the WordPress deployment based on traffic.
- A strategy to ensure the data in the MySQL database is backed up periodically.
- Thinking: Ensuring scalability and security, reduces risk and potential downtime.

**Score for Step 1**: N/A (Self-evaluation not required)

### Conclusion of Step 1
All experts agree on setting up the necessary components but with different focuses: operational base setup (Expert A), deployment strategy (Expert B), and security/scalability considerations (Expert C). All perspectives are crucial.

```
Each expert will evaluate how effective this configuration is for their focus areas. If any configuration aspect is deemed ineffective or incorrect by all experts, adjustments will be made accordingly.
