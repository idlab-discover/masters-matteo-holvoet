### Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect

#### Step 1: Define the MySQL Deployment
- **Thinking:** For MySQL, we will need a Deployment to ensure its pods can be managed and scaled appropriately. Additionally, it requires a PersistentVolumeClaim for data storage, ensuring data persistence across pod restarts.
- **YAML Snippet:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: mypassword # Note: Use secrets in a real scenario
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

#### Expert 2: DevOps Specialist

#### Step 1: Define MySQL Deployment
- **Thinking:** The MySQL container requires a secure and consistent storage option, along with a straightforward deployment strategy. It should handle database faults through recovery or scalability.
- **YAML Snippet**:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-pv-mount
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-pv-mount
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

#### Expert 3: Cloud Infrastructure Engineer

#### Step 1: Define the MySQL Deployment and PersistentVolumeClaim
- **Thinking:** Focus on stability and persistence, essential for any database. MySQL needs a perfectly sized persistent volume, and security considerations such as using Kubernetes secrets are vital.
- **YAML Snippet**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: user
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: rootpassword
        volumes:
        - name: mysql-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pvc
```

### Expert Analysis and Scoring

Upon evaluating the steps and implementations shared:

1. **Expert 1** - provides a focused, secure, and functionally comprehensive YAML for MySQL, including a definition for PVC, which meets Kubernetes best practices. **Score: 5**
2. **Expert 2** - gives similar attention to storage and includes secrets but lacks complete configuration for them in the manifest provided. Would need additional YAML for secret definition or description. **Score: 4**
3. **Expert 3** - offers added detail regarding MySQL users and databases, which is useful for a structured deployment strategy. Also includes necessary persistent volumes. The YAML, however, includes hardcoded passwords, recommending improvement here. **Score: 4**

### Next Steps: Define WordPress Deployment

All experts are expected to provide a similar approach for deploying WordPress, connecting it to the MySQL service, considering secrets for environment variables, service definitions to expose WordPress, and potentially use of ConfigMaps for additional configurations.

**Note:** For a comprehensive solution, we would proceed with creating the WordPress deployment in a fashion similar to the MySQL setup, ensuring environment variables connect WordPress to MySQL correctly and setting up services to expose WordPress publicly.
