### Expert 1 (Kubernetes Administrator)

#### Step 1: Define the MySQL Deployment
- **Description**: I will start by creating a YAML manifest for the MySQL deployment. This includes defining the deployment metadata, specifying the MySQL container, setting environment variables like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD for authentication, and specifying a volume for persistent storage.
- **Thinking**: The persistent volume is crucial for data durability across pod recreations. Using secrets for sensitive information enhances security.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

#### Expert 1 Self-Score: 5
I believe this manifest is correctly structured, secure, and suitable for a MySQL deployment.

### Expert 2 (DevOps Engineer)

#### Step 1: Define the MySQL Deployment
- **Description**: As with the Kubernetes Administrator’s approach, I also start by creating a YAML file for MySQL. In addition to the deployment specifics, I will add readiness and liveness probes to ensure the container’s health is monitored.
- **Thinking**: Probes help manage container life-cycle efficiently by checking the health of the containers and restarting them if they fail.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        args: ["--default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password"]
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: rootpassword  # This should ideally be a secret
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        livenessProbe:
          tcpSocket:
            port: 3306
          initialDelaySeconds: 45
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          tcpSocket:
            port: 3306
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
```

#### Expert 2 Self-Score: 4
I am confident this setup with probes will improve the deployment's reliability; however, using plaintext for MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is not ideal.

### Expert 3 (Cloud Architect)

#### Step 1: Define the MySQL Deployment
- **Description**: Like the previous experts, setting up MySQL involves initializing a deployment. I would emphasize on using a ConfigMap apart from secrets to manage configuration data and environmental variables. Additionally, leveraging a service to expose the deployment.
- **Thinking**: ConfigMaps allow smoother configuration changes without hard coding them into deployment scripts, while a service ensures the database is consistently accessible.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mysql-config
data:
  user: root
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-config
              key: user
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
```

#### Expert 3 Self-Score: 5
My configuration ensures flexibility, security, and accessibility, aligning with best practices in Kubernetes deployment.

### Consensus Analysis
All three experts presented valid and logical steps towards deploying MySQL in Kubernetes, focusing on security and reliability but differing in aspects like monitoring through probes and external configuration management. The best approach would usually combine these elements:

- Secure handling of passwords using secrets (from Expert 1 and 3).
- Health checks with readiness and liveness probes (from Expert 2).
- Use of ConfigMaps and services for flexible configuration and networking (from Expert 3).

Based on a holistic review, the combined expertise gives a robust deployment strategy for MySQL. Next steps would involve a similar detailed approach for deploying WordPress, ensuring it connects seamlessly to the MySQL service.
