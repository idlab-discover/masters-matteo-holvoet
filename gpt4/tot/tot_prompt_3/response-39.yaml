To address this Kubernetes scenario, let's frame our experts in this manner:

1. Kubernetes Administrator: Expert in setting up and configuring Kubernetes clusters, including deployments and services.
2. DevOps Engineer: Specialist in CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts, and overall application deployment lifecycles including containerization tools.
3. Database Administrator: Focused on SQL databases, particularly MySQL, and how they integrate with various applications including WordPress.

### Step 1: Define the Kubernetes Deployment for MySQL
**Kubernetes Administrator**:  
"A Deployment ensures that a specified number of pod replicas run at any given time. For MySQL, a single replica should suffice to start. We also need a PersistentVolume to ensure data persistence across pod restarts."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: wordpresspassword
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```
**DevOps Engineer**:  
"For MySQL, the container needs environment variables for the MySQL root password; pertinently, this deployment integrates a persistent volume via PVC to safeguard MySQL data."

**Database Administrator**:  
"The MySQL deployment should set up a robust authentication system using environment variables, and the data must be stored on a PersistentVolume to prevent data loss during pod recycling."

### Expert Scores:
- Kubernetes Administrator Score: 5 (Precise detail on Kubernetes resources)
- DevOps Engineer Score: 4 (Accurate, less detailed on Kubernetes specifics)
- Database Administrator Score: 4 (Appropriate focus on database persistence, less on Kubernetes configuration nuances)

### Step 2: Define the PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL
**Kubernetes Administrator**:  
"A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is required to claim storage space defined by a PersistentVolume. This space will store the database files securely."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
```
**DevOps Engineer**:  
"The PVC should be sized to handle growth in data. ReadWriteOnce accessibility ensures that only one node can mount the volume at a time, fitting for a database."

**Database Administrator**:  
"PVC for MySQL should cater to expected data expansion. Aligning the size and access modes of the PVC with MySQL usage patterns is crucial."

### Expert Scores:
- Kubernetes Administrator Score: 5 (Correctly identifies PVC details and purpose)
- DevOps Engineer Score: 5 (Insights on scalability and practical configuration)
- Database Administrator Score: 4 (Good rationale, slightly less technical detail about Kubernetes claims)

### Step 3: Define the Kubernetes Deployment for WordPress
**Kubernetes Administrator**:  
"For scalability, I would recommend a WordPress deployment with a scalable replica configuration. It should communicate with the MySQL service through environment variables."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: wordpresspassword
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
**DevOps Engineer**:  
"WordPress deployment should be robustly configured for high availability with multiple replicas. Env vars should define the DB host and password derived from the MySQL container."

**Database Administrator**:  
"The communication between WordPress and MySQL must be secured through environment configurations that point WordPress to the MySQL service accurately."

### Expert Scores:
- Kubernetes Administrator Score: 5 (Comprehensive deployment strategy)
- DevOps Engineer Score: 5 (Practical and scalable solution)
- Database Administrator Score: 4 (Correct focus but slightly less detailed on the exact env variables setup)

### Consensus and Final Analysis
The Kubernetes Administrator provided highly technical and detailed steps for setting up both MySQL and WordPress deployments, gaining a consistent score of 5. The DevOps Engineer also proposed practical solutions that align with best practices for DevOps and scored equally well. The Database Administrator, though slightly less technical about Kubernetes specifics, still provided valid points particularly around database management.

**Best Guess Solution**: Following the Kubernetes Administrator's and DevOps Engineer's combined recommendations would be the most robust approach. Combining detailed deployment strategies with insights on scalability and practicality from both yields the best setup for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend on Kubernetes.
