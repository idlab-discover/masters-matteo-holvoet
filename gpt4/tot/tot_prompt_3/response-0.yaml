### Expert 1: Kubernetes/YAML Configuration Specialist

**Step 1: Defining WordPress Deployment and Service**
- For deploying WordPress on Kubernetes, we need to create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest. This deployment will have a container named "wordpress" that will run the WordPress image. Additionally, a Kubernetes Service is necessary to expose the WordPress application to the public.
- Thinking: Kubernetes deployments manage the pods' lifecycle, ensuring they're replaced if they fail. Services allow external access to a set of pods, in this case, our WordPress site.

**Manifest:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

### Expert 2: Database and Storage Engineer

**Step 1: Defining MySQL Deployment and Persistent Volume**
- MySQL will run as a separate deployment from WordPress. We ensure data persistence through Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC). A Deployment for the MySQL database will use these resources to maintain data across pod restarts and failures.
- Thinking: Data persistence is crucial for any database application, especially in production environments; hence using PV and PVC ensures data isn't lost when the pod is rescheduled or deleted.

**Manifest:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: manual
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

### Expert 3: Application Deployment Coordinator

**Step 1: Integrating Components**
- Ensuring the WordPress container communicates securely with MySQL, leverage Kubernetes secrets for storing the database's credentials. Both WordPress and MySQL deployments should be orchestrated to interact seamlessly. WordPress should use environment variables sourced from these secrets to connect to MySQL.
- Thinking: Security and interaction between WordPress and its MySQL backend are paramount. Kubernetes secrets provide a secure way to manage sensitive data like database passwords.

**Manifest:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: encoded-password # place your base64 encoded password here
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-volume
```
