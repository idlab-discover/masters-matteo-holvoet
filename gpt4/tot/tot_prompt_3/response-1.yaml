### Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect

**Step 1: Define the overall architecture of the deployment**
- WordPress and MySQL will be deployed as separate containers.
- Use a PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for data retention for MySQL.
- Define a Kubernetes Deployment for both WordPress and MySQL.
- Use a Service to expose WordPress to the internet.

**Thinking:**
In a typical deployment scenario, isolation of services (like WordPress and MySQL) into separate containers enhances scalability and maintainability. Persistent volumes are critical for database integrity across pod restarts. Deployments will help manage the state and rollout of each containerized application, while a Service makes the WordPress site accessible.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
```

### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

**Step 1: Implementation specifics for continuous deployment and resource management**
- Utilize ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data for WordPress and MySQL.
- Define resource limits in the Kubernetes Deployment to ensure QoS (Quality of Service).
- Incorporate health checks (liveness and readiness probes) to enhance system reliability.

**Thinking:**
ConfigMaps reduce hardcoding of non-sensitive data, making the application more configurable and Kubernetes-native. Secrets are necessary for safely handling passwords or sensitive data. Setting up resource limits helps in preventing one application from consuming all resources and affecting other services. Probes ensure the applications are running healthily and can serve traffic or connect to databases effectively.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          secretKeyRef:
            name: mysql-secret
            key: password
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
          limits:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: "1"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 80
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 80

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

### Expert 3: Cloud Solutions Architect

**Step 1: Integrate with cloud-native solutions for enhanced scalability and security**
- Leverage cloud provider's capabilities such as managed database services or container orchestration adjustments.
- Implement ingress for better URL routing and SSL termination for WordPress.
- Explore use of Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for addressing variable load.

**Thinking:**
Using managed services can offload some operational burdens such as maintenance and scaling of the database. Ingress controllers are crucial for managing external access to services within Kubernetes in a more structured and secure manner. Auto-scaling ensures that the deployments can handle increased load without manual intervention.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: wordpress-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: wordpress.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: wordpress
          servicePort: 80
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - wordpress.example.com
    secretName: wordpress-tls

---
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: wordpress-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: wordpress
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
```

### Analysis and Consensus

Each expert's input is valuable in different aspects of deploying WordPress with MySQL on Kubernetes:

1. **Kubernetes Architect:** Focuses on essential elements such as PVs, PVCs, and basic service structures. This is fundamental and gets a high rating for ensuring basic operational needs.

2. **DevOps Engineer:** Adds critical details related to operational excellence such as configuration management, resource limits, and health checks, which are vital for maintainable production deployments.

3. **Cloud Solutions Architect:** Brings a high-level strategic view, considering cloud-native features and autoscaling which is important for scalability and performance in a real-world scenario.

Given that all aspects are important, a holistic approach combining all three experts' views would provide a robust deployment strategy for the WordPress site with MySQL database. This composite approach guarantees performance, scalability, and operational efficiency.
