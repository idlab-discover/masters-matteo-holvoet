Let's break this task into different steps, and each expert will provide their input on the solution. We will create a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend.

### Step 1: Define the MySQL Deployment
- **Expert 1 (Kubernetes Cluster Architect):**  
  - **Thought Process:** The MySQL container is a critical part of this application stack. High reliability and data persistence are necessary. Thus, a Deployment managing a Pod with a MySQL container should be used. We need to set up a PersistentVolumeClaim to ensure data isn't lost on pod deletion. The deployment must expose MySQL's default port 3306.
  - **YAML Specification:**
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: mysql
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: mysql
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: mysql
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:5.7
          ports:
          - containerPort: 3306
          env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-root-password
                key: password
          volumeMounts:
          - name: mysql-data
            mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
        volumes:
        - name: mysql-data
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pvc
  ```

- **Expert 2 (Database Specialist):**  
  - **Thought Process:** MySQL needs to be configured correctly for WordPress. Initialization of the database schema is necessary. I would recommend using the same Deployment approach but emphasize on the Kubernetes secrets, which must be created separately for security purposes.
  - **YAML Specification:** *Same as above; emphasizes the creation and use of Kubernetes secrets.*

- **Expert 3 (DevOps Engineer):**  
  - **Thought Process:** Agrees with the integration of persistent volume for MySQL. Points out the importance of MySQL configuration via ConfigMaps for flexibility. Suggests automatically restarting failed containers.
  - **YAML Specification:** *Similar to the above; incorporates elements of ConfigMaps for configuration details.*

### Scoring for Step 1:
- **Expert 1:** 5 (since the setup is comprehensive and focuses on persistence and security)
- **Expert 2:** 4 (good consideration towards security but lacks additional details on deployment nuances such as resource limits)
- **Expert 3:** 4 (introduced ConfigMaps, but didn't fully specify how it's used, missing direct integration examples in YAML)

**All Experts move to Step 2: Define the WordPress Deployment**

### Step 2: Define the WordPress Deployment
- **Expert 1 (Kubernetes Cluster Architect):**  
  - **Thought Process:** WordPress requires a web server, PHP, and connection to MySQL. Using a Deployment that manages the WordPress container is key. Needs a service to expose it on a certain port, and an environment variable for the database connection.
  - **YAML Specification:**
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: wordpress
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: wordpress
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: wordpress
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
          env:
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
            value: mysql
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-root-password
                key: password
  ```

- **Expert 2 (Database Specialist):**  
  - **Thought Process:** Focused on ensuring the WordPress deployment can securely connect to MySQL using the right environmental variables pulled from secrets. Suggests readability improvements in YAML.
  - **YAML Specification:** *Similar to above with minor formatting changes for better clarity.*

- **Expert 3 (DevOps Engineer):**  
  - **Thought Process:** Highlights the need for readiness and liveness probes in the WordPress deployment to ensure the application is always running smoothly.
  - **YAML Specification:** *Adds readiness and liveness probes to the WordPress container specification.*

### Scoring for Step 2:
- **Expert 1:** 5 (clearly defined and functional setup)
- **Expert 2:** 4 (valid but minor changes do not significantly impact deployment)
- **Expert 3:** 5 (crucial addition of health checks)

### Conclusion:

Based on the scores and the provided advantages by each expert's input, the optimal Kubernetes YAML manifests for a WordPress and MySQL deployment should combine the detailed deployment strategy of Expert 1 with the vital additions of health checks from Expert 3. Expert 2â€™s inputs stay relevant mainly towards security but is similarly covered by Expert 1 and Expert 3's combined approach.
