### Step 1: Define the Kubernetes Deployment for MySQL

#### Expert 1: Kubernetes Engineer

**Analysis**: To deploy MySQL, we need a deployment and a persistent volume to maintain the database state even if the pod goes down. I suggest creating a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that dynamically provisions storage, and a Deployment resource that defines the MySQL container with the necessary environment variables for usernames and passwords.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: "yourpassword"
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: "wordpress"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

**Thinking**: This configuration defines the necessary resources for MySQL and ensures data retention through a persistent volume.

#### Expert 2: DevOps Consultant

**Analysis**: Agree with the Kubernetes Engineer's approach but recommend adding readiness and liveness probes to the MySQL container to ensure it is properly started before being served and remains healthy.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: "yourpassword"
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: "wordpress"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        livenessProbe:
          tcpSocket:
            port: 3306
          initialDelaySeconds: 45
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          tcpSocket:
            port: 3306
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

**Thinking**: Adding probes improves the reliability of the service by managing the container lifecycle based on the state of the MySQL server.

#### Expert 3: Cloud Architect

**Analysis**: Both previous configurations are correct for deploying MySQL. For additional security, I recommend including Kubernetes secrets to manage the database credentials instead of hard coding them in the manifest.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: "eW91cnBhc3N3b3Jk"  # base64 encoded password

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: "wordpress"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

**Thinking**: Utilizing secrets not only secures sensitive data but also makes the system easy to manage in terms of credentials updates.

### Step-by-Step Experts' Ratings and Consideration

Each expert would evaluate the others based on the completeness, security, and practicality of their proposed solutions. However, given this platform's constraints, I will analyze and provide the consensus.

**Solution**: Combining all expert insights leads to a robust MySQL component of the Kubernetes deployment, which includes a PVC for persistence, resource definition with liveness and readiness probes, and the use of secrets for securing database credentials. This comprehensive approach provides a well-rounded base for the next steps in setting up a WordPress Kubernetes deployment.
