#### Step 1: Define MySQL Deployment
The first step involves creating a MySQL deployment manifest. MySQL will require Persistent Volume to ensure the data persists across pod restarts. A StatefulSet is suitable for this purpose, but for simplicity, a Deployment with a PersistentVolumeClaim would be adequate too. Here we configure the MySQL container named "mysql", expose the necessary port, and use environment variables for MySQL credentials.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

### Expert 2: Kubernetes DevOps Engineer

#### Step 1: Define MySQL Deployment
Creating a YAML file for the MySQL deployment focusing on high availability and security would be essential. We can use a Deployment resource to manage the application. Ensure that the deployment strategy handles updates correctly, and use ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data respectively.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-configmap
              key: database-name
      volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: mysql-storage
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

### Expert 3: Kubernetes Application Developer

#### Step 1: Define MySQL Deployment
For deploying MySQL, it's imperative to focus on configurability and maintenance ease. Kubernetes Deployments alongside persistent volumes allow for manageable and updatable configurations. By defining environments variables directly and using a predefined PersistentVolumeClaim, we maintain ease of application without advanced configurations.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: verystrongpassword
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
      volumes:
      - name: data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Analysis and Consensus

As we analyze the manifests proposed by each expert, we note that all have correctly set up a basic MySQL deployment with persistent storage, environment configurations, and necessary ports. Each expert emphasizes different aspects:

- **Expert 1** focuses on simplicity and core functionality.
- **Expert 2** emphasizes security and configuration management using Kubernetes native resources like ConfigMap and Secrets.
- **Expert 3** opts for straightforward config but lacks emphasis on best security practices.

The consensus seems to lean towards Expert 2's strategy considering the full Kubernetes feature utilization including security-oriented configurations, which is crucial for production environments.
