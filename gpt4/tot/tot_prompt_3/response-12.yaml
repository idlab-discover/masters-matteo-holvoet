#### Step 1: Define MySQL Deployment
I start by writing a Deployment manifest for MySQL. This requires a container named "mysql", and I will use the `mysql:5.7` image. It is critical to make sure that the MySQL database is persistent and secured, hence I will define a PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) for data storage and set environment variables for credentials (using ConfigMaps or Secrets, primarily Secrets for sensitive data).

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

#### Step 2: Define MySQL PVC
For MySQL data persistence, I'll use a PersistentVolumeClaim. This will ensure that our data is safeguarded across pod restarts and crashes.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

#### Step 3: Define WordPress Deployment
I will draft a Deployment for WordPress, ensuring it connects to MySQL. I'll set an environment variable for the MySQL service host and use a Secret for the MySQL database password. This ensures the WordPress pod knows where to find the database and has credentials to access it.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
