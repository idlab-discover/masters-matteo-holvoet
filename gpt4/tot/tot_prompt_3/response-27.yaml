### Expert 1: Kubernetes Infrastructure Architect

**Step 1: Kubernetes Deployment Manifest for MySQL**

As a Kubernetes Infrastructure Architect, my priority is to ensure the MySQL database has a persistent storage solution to avoid any data loss. I will use a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to ensure data persists across pod restarts.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: mypassword
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

**Step 2: Kubernetes Deployment Manifest for WordPress**

Next, I need to ensure the WordPress application is robustly set up, connecting to MySQL while also being exposed externally. Therefore, a Kubernetes deployment and a service for network access will be necessary.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: mypassword
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

**Step 3: Analysis and Consensus**

As both a Kubernetes Infrastructure Architect and a deployment analyst, my approach focused on ensuring that both WordPress and MySQL are correctly configured to function together. I've considered persistence, security (via environment variables for MySQL passwords), and practical access to WordPress via a service type of LoadBalancer.

I will rank both contributions and provide scores for the respective steps:
- For MySQL: The use of PersistentVolumeClaim is essential, and handling passwords via environment variables is security-practical, earning it a 5/5.
- For WordPress: Configuration linking the WordPress instance correctly with the MySQL deployment, and exposing it via a LoadBalancer service, also receives a 5/5.
