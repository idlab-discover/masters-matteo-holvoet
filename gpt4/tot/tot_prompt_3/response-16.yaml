### Step 1: Identifying Preliminary Requirements

**Expert 1 - Kubernetes Architect**  
Thinking: Before we design the manifest, we need to assess the core components required by WordPress and MySQL. WordPress will require a web server and PHP runtime environment, while MySQL simply needs its database environment. They will communicate over a network, so proper service definitions are crucial.
  
**Expert 2 - Database Administrator**  
Thinking: MySQL needs persistent storage to ensure that the database data remains intact across pod recreations. It’s also essential from a security perspective to handle MySQL credentials securely, potentially using Kubernetes secrets.

**Expert 3 - Security Specialist**  
Thinking: Apart from considering network and data security between WordPress and MySQL, ensuring the least privilege on the Kubernetes roles and using secure, updated images are fundamental. Configuring network policies to restrict traffic between the two can minimize potential attack surfaces.

### Scoring:
- **Expert 1:** 4 (Solid understanding of composite applications on Kubernetes)
- **Expert 2:** 5 (Correctly emphasized the importance of persistent storage and secure handling of credentials)
- **Expert 3:** 4 (Appropriate focus on security but lacks detail in the context directly relating to Kubernetes configurations)

### Step 2: Creating Kubernetes YAML Manifest

**Expert 1 - Kubernetes Architect**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**Expert 2 - Database Administrator**
Thinking: Kubernetes architect’s configuration looks comprehensive but didn't include the secret definition for MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD and WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD, which is critical.

**Expert 3 - Security Specialist**
Thinking: Proper configuration but lacked an example to restrict network traffic between services using network policies.

### Scoring:
- **Expert 1:** 4 (Excellent deployment setup but overlooked the secret object definition)
- **Expert 2:** 5 (Correctly identified missing aspects in security practices)
- **Expert 3:** 3 (Important considerations, though more details in configuration would strengthen the review)

### Conclusion:
Taking into account all provided analysis and integrating the essential components from each expert:
1. Architect's structure for Kubernetes manifest is mostly sound with an emphasis on connectivity and persistent configurations.
2. From the database administrator, adding a Secrets configuration is necessary to secure sensitive data.
3. From the security specialist, include network policies for enhanced security, though not explicitly detailed here, should ideally be reflected in operational configurations.

The consensus solution would involve integrating these insights into a comprehensive and robust Kubernetes manifest for deploying WordPress with MySQL.
