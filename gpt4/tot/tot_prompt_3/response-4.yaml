### Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect

#### Step 1: Define the YAML structure for MySQL Deployment
As a Kubernetes Architect, I'm proposing a two-part deployment: one for WordPress and another for MySQL. Starting with MySQL, a Deployment manages pods that will house the MySQL container. Here's the template YAML for MySQL:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: rootpassword
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: wpuser
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value: wppassword
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
```

### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

#### Step 1: Propose Kubernetes Services for MySQL
Alongside the Deployment, we need to expose the MySQL database. I suggest using a Kubernetes Service of type ClusterIP to expose it internally. This service will be accessed by WordPress internally, therefore there's no need for external exposure. Here is the YAML for the MySQL service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```

### Expert 3: Web Application Developer

#### Step 1: Creating WordPress Deployment and Service
Since the backend is covered by other experts, as a Web Application Developer, I propose how to handle the WordPress deployment and service. Here are the templates for each:

**WordPress Deployment YAML**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: wpuser
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: wppassword
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**WordPress Service YAML**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

### Expert Assessment Round:

**Expert 1 Scores**:
- Expert 2: 5 (Logical and necessary service exposition)
- Expert 3: 5 (Accurate and scalable WordPress frontend handling)

**Expert 2 Scores**:
- Expert 1: 5 (Clearly executed setup of MySQL deployment)
- Expert 3: 5 (Proper linking of WordPress to MySQL via environment variables)

**Expert 3 Scores**:
- Expert 1: 5 (Secure, well-environment configured MySQL deployment)
- Expert 2: 5 (Effective internal network service for MySQL)

### Conclusion: 

All three experts provided complementary inputs to successfully deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL backend. The setup involves two deployments and two services, one set each for MySQL and WordPress. No peer was judged to be incorrect, so all stayed till the end, and the solution was determined by consensus. Each YAML manifest is crucial and works in harmony to establish the necessary infrastructure in Kubernetes for running WordPress with a MySQL database backend.
