#### Step 1: Create MySQL Deployment
- **Thinking**: MySQL will need a persistent storage to retain data across pod restarts and a secret to store the database credentials securely.
  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

#### Step 1: Prepare MySQL Configurations and Services
- **Thinking**: MySQL should be accessible to the WordPress pod within the cluster but not outside. A service is necessary for that purpose along with security best practices for password management.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

#### Step 1: MySQL Deployment and Persistent Storage
- **Thinking**: Given the need for data persistence and access, MySQL requires both a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and a deployment strategy to maintain database integrity.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Consensus on Step 1:
All experts agree on using a Secret for the MySQL password, a Deployment with a persistent volume claim for MySQL data retention, and environment variable from the Secret. The manifests mostly align with best practices and the goals of the scenario. Thus, the consensus seems to be achieved among all experts' proposals for deploying MySQL.

- **Proceed to the Next Step**: Define WordPress deployment and required services connecting to MySQL.
