### Expert 1: Kubernetes Infrastructure Specialist

#### Step 1: Basic Kubernetes Deployment Configurations for WordPress and MySQL
- Define two separate deployments in the manifest, one for WordPress and one for MySQL.
  - For WordPress: Use the official WordPress image, set the container name as "wordpress", and ensure it has the necessary environment variables for connecting to MySQL.
  - For MySQL: Use the MySQL image, name the container "mysql", and define the environment variables for the MySQL root password and database details.

#### Thinking:
Both WordPress and MySQL should run in separate pods for isolation and scalability. Using official images ensures compatibility and ease of deployment.

```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: wordpressuser
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password

---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
```

### Expert 2: Kubernetes Network and Service Specialist

#### Step 1: Create Services for WordPress and MySQL
- Define Kubernetes services for both WordPress and MySQL to enable network access.
  - WordPress: Expose the service on a standard web port, connect it to the WordPress deployment.
  - MySQL: Expose it internally using a ClusterIP to allow only internal access from WordPress.

#### Thinking:
Services are critical for defining network access. WordPress needs external exposure, and MySQL should be accessible only within the cluster for security.

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress

---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```

### Expert 3: Kubernetes Security Specialist

#### Step 1: Ensuring Security and Secrets Management
- Implement Kubernetes secrets to securely pass sensitive data like MySQL passwords.
  - Use a Kubernetes Secret object to store the MySQL root password and WordPress database credentials.

#### Thinking:
Using Secrets for sensitive data is crucial to ensuring security in deployment. This approach prevents hard-coding sensitive data into deployment configurations.

```yaml
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD
```

### Analysis and Consensus:
All experts contributed essential parts of a comprehensive Kubernetes deployment for a WordPress website with a MySQL backend. Integrating each expert's contributions yields a fully functional and secure deployment.

- **Consensus Solution**: Combine all provided YAML manifests from each expert to create a complete deployment. This includes deployments, services, and secrets to ensure functionality and security.
