## Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect

### Step 1: Define the Kubernetes Deployment for MySQL
- **Thinking**: Start by defining a PersistentVolume (PV) to ensure data persistence for MySQL. Use a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for storage request. Create a Deployment for MySQL with environment variables for the database setup.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data/mysql"

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: my-secret-pw
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Step 2: Define the Kubernetes Deployment for WordPress
- **Thinking**: Use a Deployment for WordPress linked to the MySQL database. Define readiness and liveness probes to ensure the container is properly started. Use environment variables to connect to MySQL.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: my-secret-pw
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

### Step 1: MySQL Deployment Configuration
- **Thinking**: Agree with the creation of PV and PVC. Suggests adding security configurations, like not running as root and using a specific MySQL version that is known for stability and security.

```yaml
# Expert 1's MySQL YAML with the following comments:
# Add securityContext to ensure MySQL does not run as a root user.
# Pin MySQL to a more specific version noted for long-term stability.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 999
# Further configuration remains the same.
```

### Step 2: WordPress Configuration
- **Thinking**: Suggests configuring readiness and liveness probes for WordPress for better management of container lifecycle. Include resource limits to ensure pod stability under load.

```yaml
# Expert 1's WordPress YAML with the following comments:
# Adding readiness and liveness probes to enhance reliability.
# Define resource requests and limits.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "64Mi"
              cpu: "250m"
            limits:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 80
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            periodSeconds: 30
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 80
            initialDelaySeconds: 15
            periodSeconds: 20
# Further configuration remains the same.
```

## Expert 3: Cloud Security Specialist

### Step 1: Comment on MySQL Security
- **Thinking**: Emphasizes the importance of using Kubernetes Secrets for MySQL passwords instead of plain text in environment variables.

```yaml
# Expert 1 and 2's MySQL YAML with the following comments:
# Replacement of environment variable MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD with a secretKeyRef.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-secret
                  key: password
# Additional security configurations are maintained.
```

### Step 2: Secure WordPress Configuration
- **Thinking**: Proposes using Secrets for WordPress environmental variables as well, especially for database passwords. Advocates for network policies to restrict traffic between the pods.

```yaml
# Expert 1 and 2's WordPress YAML with suggested changes:
# Incorporation of secrets instead of direct password inclusion in env variables.
# Recommendation for network policies.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-secret
                  key: password
# Security and resource configurations are followed.
```

### Conclusion
Each expert contributes to a more robust configuration; Kubernetes Architect sets up the initial structure, DevOps Engineer adds life-cycle and resource management, and Cloud Security Specialist fortifies the security elements. Combining these insights and configurations would yield a highly effective solution for deploying WordPress with MySQL on Kubernetes.
