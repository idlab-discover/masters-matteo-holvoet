### Expert 1: Kubernetes Engineer

**Step 1**: Define volumes for persistent storage
- **Thinking**: To ensure data persistence for both WordPress content and MySQL databases across pod restarts, it's essential to create PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) resources. This step ensures that user data and database entries are not lost when containers are recreated.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wp-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

### Expert 2: DevOps Specialist

**Step 1**: Begin with defining the Deployment for MySQL
- **Thinking**: MySQL should be set up before WordPress to ensure that the database is ready when WordPress installs. Using the Deployment resource type allows the application to be managed easily and supports horizontal scaling.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: "yourpassword"
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: "wordpress"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Expert 3: Cloud Architect

**Step 1**: Deployment YAML for WordPress
- **Thinking**: Setting up WordPress requires configuring it to connect to the MySQL database. The Deployment should define environment variables that WordPress uses to establish this connection. It's important the WordPress deployment starts only after the MySQL database is ready.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: "yourpassword"
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: "wordpress"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/www/html
          name: wordpress-storage
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wp-pv-claim
```

### Analysis and Conclusion
- **Kubernetes Engineer**: Focuses on storage and data durability, essential for real-world applications, scoring this higher on practical setup.
- **DevOps Specialist**: Prioritizes the backend setup accurately and ensures security with environment variables, which is crucial.
- **Cloud Architect**: Correctly tackles the architectural layout of the WordPress deployment, including connectivity and runtime environment, pertinent for application functionality.

All experts provide complementary, crucial aspects of the Kubernetes deployment for WordPress backed by MySQL, and thus, a combination of these steps in sequence would likely create a functional, robust application. In reality, combining the Kubernetes Engineer's approach for volume setup, the DevOps Specialistâ€™s mysql preparation, and finally the Cloud Architect's application setup provides a comprehensive and practical deployment strategy.
