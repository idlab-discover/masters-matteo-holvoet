### Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect

#### Step 1: Define MySQL Deployment YAML
As a Kubernetes architect, my first step is to create a Deployment for the MySQL database. The Deployment ensures that a specified number of MySQL pod replicas are running at any given time. MySQL needs persistent storage to save the database files, so we need to use a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

**MySQL Deployment YAML**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

#### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

#### Step 1: Define MySQL PersistentVolumeClaim YAML
As a DevOps engineer, setting up the MySQL PVC is crucial to ensure data persistence across pod restarts. This handles dynamically allocating storage from a defined storage class.

**MySQL PersistentVolumeClaim YAML**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

#### Expert 3: Application Developer

#### Step 1: Define WordPress Deployment YAML
As an application developer, I'd focus on setting up WordPress, ensuring it can communicate with the MySQL backend. Proper environment variables should be set up for database connectivity.

**WordPress Deployment YAML**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Peer Scoring
- **Expert 1 scores Expert 2**: 5 (Correctly considers data persistence, which is key for a database)
- **Expert 1 scores Expert 3**: 5 (Correct deployment setup for WordPress, environment variables are appropriately referenced)
- **Expert 2 scores Expert 1**: 5 (Deployment correctly includes both the MySQL application and storage components)
- **Expert 2 scores Expert 3**: 5 (Appropriate setup for connecting WordPress to MySQL)
- **Expert 3 scores Expert 1**: 5 (MySQL deployment is correctly set up with environmental variables and volume mounts)
- **Expert 3 scores Expert 2**: 5 (PVC setup aligns with standard practices)

### Consensus Analysis
Following the expertise shared, the consensus among the experts is that the YAML manifests are correctly set up, taking into account necessary elements for persistence, connection, and deployment. The scored responses ensure the reliability of each step. Combining these configurations would successfully deploy a WordPress site with MySQL database backend on a Kubernetes cluster.
