**Step 1: Create a MySQL Deployment YAML**
- The MySQL deployment requires defining a Deployment and Service object. The Deployment will include the container specification for MySQL, using the MySQL image, and necessary environment variables such as MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD for the initial root password. The Service object will provide network access to the MySQL instance.
  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:5.7
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: "verysecret"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

**Step 1: Create a MySQL Deployment YAML**
- The MySQL setup needs to be robust and scalable. It includes defining a Persistent Volume Claim to ensure data persistence. Using environment variables for MySQL to setup initial configurations like root password is essential.
  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:5.7
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: "securepassword"
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
              name: mysql-data
      volumes:
        - name: mysql-data
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

Expert 3: Web Developer with a background in Docker and Kubernetes
===
**Step 1: Create a MySQL Deployment YAML**
- It’s crucial to set environment variables securely, possibly from a Kubernetes Secret rather than hardcoding. Additionally, the deployment and service definition for MySQL adheres to typical Kubernetes configurations – using a Deployment for the replica set and a ClusterIP service for internal cluster communication.
  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:5.7
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-secret
                  key: root-password
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3306
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 3306
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```

Scores:
===
**Expert 1**:
- Relevance and completeness of the solution.
- Score by Expert 2: 4
- Score by Expert 3: 4

**Expert 2**:
- Addition of persistent data management through PVC, relevant for stateful applications.
- Score by Expert 1: 5
- Score by Expert 3: 5

**Expert 3**:
- Security enhancement by suggesting the use of Kubernetes Secrets.
- Score by Expert 1: 5
- Score by Expert 2: 5

**Consensus Decision based on Analysis of Scoring**:
- All experts offered valid solutions with varying degrees of complexity and security. The consensus suggests a combined approach where environmental variables are loaded from Secrets, and a Persistent Volume Claim is used for data persistence.

**Next Steps**:
- Include WordPress Deployment YAML development in the same paradigm, ensuring services can communicate and maintaining secure practices (using secrets and persistent volumes where necessary). Each expert would use their domain knowledge focusing on security, scalability, and efficient deployment practices.
