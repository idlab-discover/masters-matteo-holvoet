```yaml
# Expert 1: Initial Manifest Creation
# I'll start by outlining the basic structure for deploying WordPress with a MySQL backend in Kubernetes.
# We'll need two Deployments and corresponding Services - one for WordPress and one for MySQL.
# Let's define the MySQL deployment and service first.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None

# Now let's define the deployment and service for WordPress.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer

# Expert 2: Review and Enhancement Suggestions
# Reviewing what Expert 1 has set up, everything looks fundamentally sound.
# However, I suggest introducing Persistence for MySQL to ensure data safety.
# I'll include a PersistentVolumeClaim for the MySQL deployment to handle data persistence.

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

# Modify the MySQL deployment to utilize this claim:
# I am also adjusting the environment variables to use a secret instead of hard coding the MySQL root password directly in the manifest.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim

# Expert 3: Final Review and Security Enhancement
# Both experts' inputs seem solid. I observe that we need to ensure the password for MySQL isn't hard-coded into the Deployment manifest by Expert 1 and has been rectified by Expert 2 using a Secret resource.
# I will now add the YAML definition for this Secret, and finalize our solution.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: [BASE64 ENCODED PASSWORD]

# This should complete our discussion. Our final YAML files now effectively deploy a WordPress site with a MySQL database, with considerations for persistence and security as improved by Expert 2 and myself.
