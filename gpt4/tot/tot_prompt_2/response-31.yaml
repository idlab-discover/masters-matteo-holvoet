metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:

# Expert 2:
# Looks good! Moving on to the WordPress part. We will define both Deployment and Service for WordPress.
# Importantly, we need to ensure that the WordPress pod can communicate with the MySQL pod via the MySQL Service we defined above.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:

          value: my-secret-pw  # Same note on security as above
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

# We also need a Service to expose WordPress to the outside world. We'll set it as type NodePort for now.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:

# Expert 3:
# Excellent work, both of you. Everything seems to be in order. 
# However, let's utilize Kubernetes Secrets to handle the MySQL password more securely. I'll add that.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: bXktc2VjcmV0LXB3  # base64 encoded password ("my-secret-pw")

---
# We need to modify both MySQL and WordPress deployments to use this Secret. I'll adjust the necessary parts.

# Adjusting the MySQL Deployment:
        # Previous MySQL env section
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password

# Adjusting the WordPress Deployment:
        # Previous WordPress env section
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
```
This sequence of interactions would include actual code changes and deployment testing in a real-world scenario, ensuring everything is set up correctly and working as expected.
