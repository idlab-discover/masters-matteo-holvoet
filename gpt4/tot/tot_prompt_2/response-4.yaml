This basic setup gets a WordPress container up, considering the database credentials will be fetched from a secret named `mysql-pass`. We must also ensure the MySQL deployment and the secret where the database password is stored.

              key: password
        ports:

I added the MySQL deployment and its corresponding service, making sure it uses the same secret `mysql-pass`. Note that a `ClusterIP` service type default would suffice since we don't need external access to the MySQL database. This integration should address the connectivity between WordPress and MySQL using Kubernetes networking.

```yaml
# Expert 3: Adding the Secret definition and final touches
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
  namespace: wordpress-namespace
type: Opaque
data:
  password: YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD
```
Here, I added the Secret manifest needed for the password management of MySQL, which both containers are dependent on. Be sure to replace `YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD` with the actual base64 encoded password. It's vital to keep security in mind by encoding sensitive information such as passwords in base64 when using Kubernetes Secrets.

The full Kubernetes configuration now properly sets up WordPress with MySQL backend within a defined namespace, ensuring component communication remains internal and secure by correct use of Kubernetes DNS for service names, and environment variables for WordPress.
