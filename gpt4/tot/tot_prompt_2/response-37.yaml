# Expert 1: Here's the basic layout for a simple Kubernetes setup for a WordPress site with a MySQL backend.
# Let's start with defining the Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to ensure that both WordPress and MySQL have storage available for their data.

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wp-pv-claim
  labels:
    app: wordpress
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

# Expert 2: Great start on the PVCs! Now, letâ€™s define the deployments for both WordPress and MySQL.
# I'll add some additional details like specifying the container image and linking the PVCs.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
  labels:
    app: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:5.8-php7.4-apache
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wp-pv-claim

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim

# Expert 3: Both the deployments are looking good! However, we need to ensure that the password for MySQL is managed through Kubernetes secrets for security purposes.
# Let me add the secret definition that Expert 2 referenced but didn't define:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: bXlzcWxfcGFzc3dvcmQ=  # This is a base64 encoded password. In production, replace "mysql_password" with an actual password and base64 encode it.

# For interacting with the WordPress site and the MySQL database externally, we should also add a service for each.
# Again, building upon the previous contributions, here are the service definitions:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
  labels:
    app: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
```
