# Expert2: Great start! Now let’s set up the WordPress deployment. Since WordPress also needs some persistent storage
# for managing stateful data like media files, we’ll also define a PersistentVolumeClaim for it. Furthermore,
# WordPress needs to communicate with the MySQL database, so let’s inject the database’s credentials into the
# WordPress container through environment variables.

# Expert3: Almost there! You both did excellent work on defining the deployments and PVCs. However,
# I noticed that we should ensure the MySQL password is securely handled. Instead of hardcoding it,
# let's use a Kubernetes secret. Also, we have not declared any LoadBalancer or NodePort service
# for WordPress to expose it externally which I'll add. And let me correct the environment variable
# for the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD which should also leverage the secret.

# Now, we have a set of resources that defines a deployment strategy for both WordPress and MySQL,
# utilizes persistent storage, handles sensitive information securely using secrets, and exposes the WordPress
# deployment externally. This should provide a robust setup for a WordPress website with a MySQL backend.
