```yaml
# Expert 1: Let's start by defining the MySQL deployment. We'll create a Kubernetes Deployment object for the MySQL server. Here's a basic structure.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: wordpress_password
# The container requires MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable for the root password.
# We use a Deployment with a `Recreate` strategy to avoid having multiple instances at the same time, which can cause conflicts.

# Expert 2: Good start by the first expert. However, for the database, we need to ensure data persistence using a volume. Let's add a PersistentVolumeClaim and bind it with the MySQL deployment.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql

        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD

        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
# Here, I added a PersistentVolumeClaim and mounted it at /var/lib/mysql in the MySQL container for data storage continuity.

# Expert 3: Excellent enhancements with the volume persistence. Now, for the WordPress side, we need a Deployment and a Service to expose it to the outside world. I will build on what has been done and add the necessary WordPress components.
