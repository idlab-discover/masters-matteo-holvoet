# Expert 1:
# First, let's define the MySQL deployment. We'll use a Deployment object for MySQL. 
# The Deployment needs a Pod with one container (mysql) and we'll mount a PersistentVolume for data persistence. 
# We'll create a Service to allow communication. Here's my initial version for MySQL:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP

# For the PersistentVolumeClaim:
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

# Expert 2:
# This looks solid for MySQL. Moving towards WordPress, we'll need a Deployment and a Service.
# Following what Expert 1 did, we'll mimic the structure but adapt for WordPress.
# Note: WordPress will communicate with MySQL, so the correct environment variables need to be set.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1

    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress

# The PersistentVolumeClaim for WordPress:
apiVersion: v1

  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

# Expert 3:
# Both manifestations from Experts 1 and 2 are essentially correct. 
# We must ensure that secrets are not hardcoded in the manifest for better security, 
# which can be introduced through Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data like MySQL root password.
# Also, let us define resources limits for our containers to ensure good performance and limit resources consumption.

# Edit MySQL and WordPress container specs to use secrets and add resources limits:

# For MySQL:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
# For WordPress:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql-service
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
