```

```yaml
Expert 2:
# Thank you, Expert 1. The MySQL configuration seems mostly good, but there are a few adjustments needed.
# The selector in the service should specifically match what is set in the deployment labels.
# I'll correct that and also add the WordPress deployment and service.

# MySQL Service adjustment:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: wordpress
    tier: mysql
  clusterIP: None

# Continuing with the WordPress deployment and service:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
    tier: frontend

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress

  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST

        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pvc

# We should ensure persistent volumes and claims are delineated outside this manifest as per requirements.
```

```yaml
Expert 3:
# Expert 2, that was an excellent addition of the WordPress component. However, we still need to address a minor oversight regarding the environment variable for the WordPress database host.
# We need to specify the MySQL service name alongside the port in the `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST` environment variable so that WordPress can connect correctly to the MySQL service within the Kubernetes network.

# Let's update that and finalize our manifest:

# Updated section for the WordPress deployment:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: "mysql:3306"  # Updated to include the MySQL service name and port.
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: user
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pvc

# With this amendment, the deployment of both MySQL and WordPress should function seamlessly within the Kubernetes environment.
```

These YAML configurations described by the experts collectively establish a functioning WordPress site backed by MySQL, each step building incrementally on the last, correcting and optimizing the configuration.
