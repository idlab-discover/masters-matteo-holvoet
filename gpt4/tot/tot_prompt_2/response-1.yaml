# Expert 3:
# Reviewing what Experts 1 and 2 provided, everything looks fundamentally sound. I'll refine the environmental setup directed at security practices by injecting secrets for passwords instead of plain text.
# Introducing Kubernetes Secret to securely manage MySQL root and WordPress database passwords.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-wp-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  mysql-root-password: "eW91cnBhc3N3b3Jk"  # encoded in base64, "yourpassword"
  mysql-db-password: "eW91cnBhc3N3b3Jk"   # might be the same or different, encoded in base64

# Update the earlier environment variable declarations in both Deployment manifests to use this secret.
# For MySQL:
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-wp-secret
              key: mysql-root-password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
# And for WordPress:
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-wp-secret
              key: mysql-db-password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
# The revised sections have enhanced the security. This whole configuration can be extended or modified based on specific operational requirements, such as scaling options or monitoring services.
```
This completes our collaboration, resulting in a robust and secure configuration for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend in a Kubernetes environment.
