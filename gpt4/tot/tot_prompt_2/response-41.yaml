# Additionally, adding the Service for MySQL so it's accessible to the WordPress pod.

# Expert 3:
# Examining the inputs from experts 1 and 2, they’ve done exceptionally well in creating the orchestrated components.
# However, I would suggest a few best practices and security enhancements.

# I recommend using a more specific version tag for the WordPress image than 'latest' to avoid unexpected updates.
# Also adjusting the MySQL environment to not use the root user for better security.

# For MySQL, I would suggest creating a dedicated user and password for WordPress.
# Adjusting Expert 2's MySQL environment variables:
apiVersion: apps/v1

  name: mysql

    spec:
      containers:

              name: mysql-secret
              key: user-password  # Assuming the secret definition is expanded to include this key.

# Adjusting WordPress deployment environment variables accordingly.

    spec:
