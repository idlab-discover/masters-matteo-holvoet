# To deploy WordPress and MySQL on Kubernetes, we will need several components:
# 1. Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) for persistent storage.
# 2. A MySQL Deployment with a corresponding Service.
# 3. A WordPress Deployment with a corresponding Service.

# Continuing from Expert 1's foundation:
# Now, let's define the MySQL deployment. Expert 1 perfectly set the stage with PVs and PVCs.
# We need a Deployment and a Service for MySQL. Also, let's make some optimizations to storage efficiency and configurations.
