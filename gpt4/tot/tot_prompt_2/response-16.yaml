# Expert 1:
# Let's start with the overall architecture for deploying WordPress with MySQL on Kubernetes. We'll use Deployments for both WordPress and MySQL, along with their respective PersistentVolumeClaims for data persistence. Each will have its own Service to expose the containers within the cluster.
# I am outlining the MySQL deployment first.

# That's the MySQL setup. Now, I would appreciate some input on the WordPress side of things.

# Expert 2:
# Great start! I'm going to now add the deployment for the WordPress container. Since WordPress needs to access the MySQL database, we'll configure it to use the MySQL service through environment variables.

    component: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer  # This will expose WordPress to the internet through a LoadBalancer provided by the cloud platform.

# Expert 3:
# Both deployments look solid! However, one key recommendation for security would be to replace clear text passwords with secrets. Kubernetes secrets would provide a more secure means of storing sensitive data like the MySQL password. Let's fix that.

### Updating the MySQL and WordPress deployment to use Kubernetes secrets
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: bXlwYXNzd29yZA==  # base64 encoded value of "mypassword"

### Modify the MySQL and WordPress deployment to use this secret
# In the MySQL deployment:
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password

# In the WordPress deployment:
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password

# Now, with the secret integration, our deployments are more secure and we have a fully functional stack to deploy WordPress with a MySQL backend.
