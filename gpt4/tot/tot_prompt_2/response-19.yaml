# Adding a Kubernetes Service for WordPress to expose it to external traffic.
# In terms of best practices, typically this would use a LoadBalancer, but for the purpose of this exercise, a simple NodePort will suffice.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30080
  selector:
    app: wordpress

```

```yaml
# Expert 3: 
# Excellent annotations by Expert 2. Building upon the security suggestions, it's ideal to continue by refining the MySQL password management.
# Expert 2 referenced the need for a secure approach to credentials which is critical for production environments.
# I'll introduce a Secret object for MySQL credentials to properly encapsulate sensitive data.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-root-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # base64 encoded value of 'password'

# Recapitulating the earlier mistake on password environment, it should not be hardcoded, even for an example, and should instead reference this secret.
# I have also noticed a slight issue with the port specification in the WordPress Service where NodePort was directly mentioned.
# It's better practice to allow Kubernetes to allocate a NodePort automatically unless a specific port is required.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress

# Overall, this configuration sets up a functional WordPress site with a MySQL backend, employing best practices for data persistence and basic security.
