Expert A: Alright, let's break down what we need for a basic WordPress deployment using MySQL on Kubernetes. First, we'll need two containers: one for WordPress and one for MySQL. We also need to handle persistence, networking, and some configuration options through environment variables. I suggest we start by outlining a Deployment for WordPress and a Deployment for MySQL.

Expert B: Building on what Expert A mentioned, I think it makes sense to create a single Kubernetes YAML file that includes everything needed. For persistence, PersistentVolumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC) will be crucial, especially for MySQL to ensure data isn't lost when pods are recreated. For networking, we can expose WordPress using a Service, which allows users to connect to it. Let’s also not forget the necessary ConfigMaps or Secrets for managing sensitive data such as MySQL passwords.

Expert C: Excellent points, both. In terms of defining the environment variables and managing the secrets securely, I propose using a Kubernetes Secret for the MySQL root password and other sensitive data. This would be referenced in the MySQL deployment. For the PersistentVolumeClaims, defining them with access modes and requesting the specific storage sizes is vital for both WordPress and MySQL. Concerning resource definitions, we should specify resource requests and limits to ensure that our containers are given enough CPU and memory to function optimally.

Continuing the discussion:

Expert A: Thanks for the suggestions on persistence and secrets management. Let’s start crafting the YAML. I'll begin with the MySQL deployment. We'll need a Deployment, Service, a PVC, and a Secret. The Secret will hold credentials, the PVC will request a specified amount of disk space, and the MySQL Service will only need to be accessible internally, so a ClusterIP type should suffice.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: base64-encoded-password

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP

Expert B: Fantastic start, A! Now, I'll add the WordPress part. Let's create a Deployment and a PVC for WordPress, and also expose it through a LoadBalancer Service to allow external access.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pv-claim

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer

Expert C: Excellent contributions from both! With those deployments, our WordPress and MySQL setup is almost complete. One minor detail I’d suggest is adding resource requests and limits to the container specs to ensure that each component has enough resources to function but not so much that it hampers the rest of the system. 

Given that, we’ve been thorough with our design - it’s robust, secure, and scalable. This setup should serve as a good foundation for anyone looking to deploy WordPress on Kubernetes. Well done!
