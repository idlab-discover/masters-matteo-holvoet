# Expert 3 consolidating and optimizing the final YAML manifest configuration

# The most recent configurations by Expert 1 and Expert 2 look well-configured. I appreciate the integration of both ConfigMap and Secret handling, laid out wisely for the MySQL and WordPress components. A seamless way to inject environment variables into our WordPress container has been structured efficiently. Just a quick suggestion to consolidate annotations for clarity and potential future Kubernetes cluster versions compatibility.

# Recommendations for improvements:
# - We might consider defining resource limits to the containers, ensuring they don't overutilize the node resources. 
# - Defining a liveness probe for WordPress alongside the readiness probe can ensure the application recovery from any issues that leave it unresponsive.

# I'm appending these minor updates:
