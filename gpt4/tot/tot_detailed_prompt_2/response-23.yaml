**Expert 1:**

Let’s start by defining the Kubernetes manifest for a WordPress website with a MySQL database. First, we need two Deployments: one for WordPress and one for MySQL. We'll also need corresponding Services to allow network access. Additionally, to handle configuration and sensitive information securely, we use a ConfigMap for non-sensitive data and Secrets for sensitive data like database passwords.

For the MySQL Deployment, we need a PersistentVolumeClaim to ensure data persistence. Let's begin by setting up the MySQL part:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: VGVzdFBhc3N3MHJk  # Base64 encoding of "TestPassw0rd"

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
```

This YAML sets a Secret for the MySQL password, a PVC for data persistence, and a basic Deployment and Service for MySQL.

That's a solid start on the MySQL part! Now, let's define the ConfigMap and the Deployment for WordPress. We will include environment variables that refer to the MySQL service to configure WordPress's database connection.

For the WordPress deployment, besides the container specification, we need to ensure that it communicates with the MySQL service:
 
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  # Configuration for connecting to MySQL
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
  WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
  WORDPRESS_DB_USER: root

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
```

This snippet completes the WordPress Deployment by referencing both the ConfigMap and Secret for configuration. Let's also add a Service for the WordPress.

**Expert 3:**

Excellent configurations from both of you! Now, to wrap up, let’s define the Service for WordPress. This will allow external traffic to reach the WordPress deployment, which is crucial for a web application like WordPress:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

This configuration exposes WordPress to the internet using a LoadBalancer service, which is typically the preferred method in a production scenario, as it allows the user to access WordPress from a standard HTTP port.

Thus, we have constructed a full Kubernetes manifest, integrating all elements including Deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PersistentVolumeClaims, and Services for both WordPress and MySQL. This achieves the objective of deploying a WordPress site with a MySQL backend in a robust and secure manner.
