Let's start by creating the basic structure for our Kubernetes manifests. We will use Deployments for both the WordPress and MySQL containers since they provide declarative updates and are suited for this kind of stateful application. I will also define the Services that allow these containers to communicate.

First, we'll outline the MySQL Deployment. Since MySQL needs to store data persistently, we'll use a PersistentVolumeClaim. For the MySQL authentication data, we’ll utilize Kubernetes Secrets to keep that information secure.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: bXktc2VjcmV0LXBhc3M=  # This is base64 encoded 'my-secret-pass'

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP

```

That’s a good start for the MySQL part! Now, for the WordPress Deployment, similarly to MySQL, we will make use of ConfigMap for non-sensitive configurations and link the MySQL database using environment variables.

I noticed a missing data piece in the MySQL Secret example - we will need the MYSQL_DATABASE environment variable as well for connectivity, which should also be a secret. I'll add this piece and connect MySQL to WordPress.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: bXktc2VjcmV0LXBhc3M=
  MYSQL_DATABASE: d29yZHByZXNz  # This is base64 encoded 'wordpress'

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
  WORDPRESS_DB_USER: root

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_DATABASE

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer
```

This is shaping up well. Both previous experts have laid out a solid foundation. However, I noticed that the Secret for MySQL is overly simplified for real applications. It might be advisable to utilize different users for different applications and permissions levels, which could be expanded upon in real use cases, but will keep it as is for simplicity here.

Also, the LoadBalancer service type for the WordPress service might not always be desirable for development environments due to cost implications and over-exposure. In such cases, it's common to use `type: NodePort` or `type: ClusterIP` and use an Ingress. But for simplicity and typical use, LoadBalancer is fine as specified.

Given the structure now, I have no further modifications; this setup should work correctly for a test deployment. We’ve nicely used ConfigMaps and Secrets to separate configuration and sensitive data. Known best practices have been observed, such as not exposing the MySQL service externally. This should provide a good starting point for anyone wanting to run WordPress with a MySQL backend on Kubernetes. Congratulations to my fellow experts on a collaborative solution!
