# Expert-A starts off the conversation,
# Laying out the basic structure for the MySQL deployment with ConfigMaps and Secrets.

# Step 1: Define Secret for storing sensitive MySQL credentials
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD

# Expert-A: "I've begun by creating a Secret for the MySQL password, which is encoded in base64.
# To continue, I've added the following MySQL Deployment and Service."

# Step 2: MySQL Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc

# Step 3: MySQL Service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql

# Expert-B analyses, verifies, and extends upon Expert-A's work,
# introducing the WordPress Deployment and Service.

# Expert-B: "Great start! For WordPress, I'll employ a similar pattern, using ConfigMap for the DB_HOST environment variable.
# Let’s now define the PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL since it’s crucial for data persistence, and then create WordPress Configs."

# Step 4: PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

# Step 5: ConfigMap and Deployment for WordPress
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  db_host: mysql

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: db_host
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

# Step 6: WordPress Service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress

# Expert-C steps in, validates, and makes minor corrections and clarifications,
# adding comments for clarity and suggestions for improvement.

# Expert-C: "Well done on the configurations. I noticed that in MySQL and WordPress Deployments,
# we properly linked the volume and environment variables. I recommend, however, using a ReadinessProbe in our WordPress Deployment.
# Introducing liveness and readiness probes can help manage the container lifecycle better,
# ensuring services are only made available once they’re ready to serve traffic."

# Update to Step 5: Include Probes in WordPress Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  modifications:
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /wp-admin/install.php
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 30
      periodSeconds: 10
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /wp-admin/install.php
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 60
      periodSeconds: 15
      failureThreshold: 3
```

# Expert-C finishes with, "By adding these probes, we enhance the robustness of the deployment, reducing potential downtimes or unresponsive services, especially under large volumes."
