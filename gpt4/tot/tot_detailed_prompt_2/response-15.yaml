# Expert 3: Adds consistency checks, minor fixes, and additional security orientations. Clarifies intentions and configurations.
# Updates required from Expert 2: Ensured the port and environment variables are correctly utilized and the connections between WordPress and MySQL are secure and efficient.

# Improved Security
# Note: In a production setting, ensure to rotate secrets regularly and do not use default container images without proper vetting.

# General Note: Experts 1 and 2 provide a solid starting point, with Expert 2 enhancing the setup by adding the WordPress components and configuration. Expert 3 addresses security considerations, including considerations for secrets management and integration details. This triad approach ensures thorough and secure deployment planning.
