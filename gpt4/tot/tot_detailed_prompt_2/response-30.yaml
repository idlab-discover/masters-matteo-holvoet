**Expert 1:**

Alright, let's start by tackling this interesting setup. We'll need two Deployments: one for WordPress and another for MySQL. Both will have their respective Services for network exposure. For data persistence in MySQL, we definitely need to utilize PersistentVolumeClaims. Using ConfigMaps and Secrets for managing configuration settings and sensitive data is crucial particularly for MySQL passwords and WordPress database secrets.

We can start by configuring the MySQL Deployment. For MySQL, we should use a `StatefulSet` instead of a `Deployment` because `StatefulSets` are more suitable for database applications that require persistent storage and stable unique network identifiers.

Here's the basic structure for the MySQL `StatefulSet` YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  serviceName: mysql
  replicas: 1  # For simplicity, assuming a single replica
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: rootpassword
```

**Expert 2:**

Building on the great start by Expert 1, let's incorporate PersistentVolumeClaims into the `StatefulSet`. We also need to consider the actual declaration of the `Secret` and possibly a `ConfigMap`, though the database configs can effectively be injected via the `Secret`.

Adding a volume claim to the `StatefulSet`:

```yaml
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumeClaimTemplates:
      - metadata:
          name: mysql-storage
        spec:
          accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 1Gi
```

And here is the definition for the `Secret` that contains the MySQL root password:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  rootpassword: YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD
```
Replace `YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD` with the actual base64-encoded password.

Expert 2 did an excellent update on Expert 1’s framework, especially highlighting persistent storage integration. Now, let’s deploy the WordPress side.

For WordPress, we need a Deployment and a corresponding Service. I will use a ConfigMap for configuring WordPress environment variables like `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST` and `WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD` that point to MySQL. Here's how this could be structured:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  database_host: mysql
  database_name: wordpress

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: database_host
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: database_name
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: rootpassword
  ```

And let’s not forget the WordPress service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: NodePort
```

This integration should be fully functional once deployed correctly in a Kubernetes cluster. It showcases the necessary components, secrets and configuration management needed for a WordPress deployment paired with a MySQL database backend.
