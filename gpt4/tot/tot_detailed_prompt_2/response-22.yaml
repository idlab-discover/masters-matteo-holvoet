**Expert 1:**  
Let’s start by defining the necessary components for this task. Firstly, we need a deployment for WordPress. Since WordPress will need to connect to MySQL, this implies that we should define the database credentials as environment variables which can be sourced from a Secret for security reasons. WordPress usually runs on port 80. Also, considering WordPress requires persistent storage for media files, we'll need a PersistentVolumeClaim for this as well. We can use the official WordPress docker image tagged to a stable version.

For the MySQL deployment, it’s crucial to use another PersistentVolumeClaim to ensure that the database data is preserved across pod restarts. MySQL also has standard environment variables like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, which should be stored in a Secret. The common MySQL Docker image could be used here, tagged to a specific version for consistency.

Using ConfigMaps and Secrets will allow us to configure both the WordPress and MySQL deployments in a secure and flexible manner. ConfigMaps can host non-sensitive data configurations while Secrets handle sensitive data securely.

Finally, each service—WordPress and MySQL—will need a Kubernetes Service to enable network access. The WordPress service should be of type LoadBalancer to expose it to the internet, while the MySQL service can remain ClusterIP as it’s only accessed internally.

Let me start drafting this as a YAML file. We can refine it as we go.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
  WORDPRESS_DB_PORT: "3306"

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # Base64 encoded "password"

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
  - port: 3306
```

**Expert 2:**  
Great start! Now for the WordPress side of things. As mentioned, we'll need to integrate environment variables pulled from our earlier defined ConfigMap as well as some new secrets for WordPress-specific configurations such as the database password. I’ll also define the PVC for WordPress, and we’ll set up the deployment and service for WordPress.

Because we want WordPress to be accessible from the internet, I’ll specify the Service with a type of LoadBalancer. I’ll continue from where you left off.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: wordpress-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # Base64 encoded "password"

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: "root"
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-secret
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: "wordpress"
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pvc

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

**Expert 3:**  
The overall setup looks comprehensive and is quite well-aligned with best practices. The use of both ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data separately is particularly commendable. Mandatory access modes have been correctly set for both PersistentVolumeClaims, reflecting typical use patterns (RWX for WordPress to potentially support replicated instances for fault tolerance, and RWO for MySQL which limits access to one node at a time which is typical for databases).

A minor point to adjust is the Secret configuration. It's best practice to avoid using the same password for different components in production, but for this exercise, it appears we’ve used the same encoded password for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, these should be different. Also, make sure the encoding for the Secrets is correct and secure as per the environment's standards. Always avoid placing literal passwords directly into YAML files in production environments.

While debugging, ensure that proper permissions are set on the storage classes to allow for volume mounting and data persistence operations. Additionally, monitoring aspects could be integrated using Kubernetes sidecars or other monitoring solutions to keep track of application health and performance.

The manifests now should be ready for deployment. Testing in a dev environment before production use is highly recommended to ensure everything is configured correctly, especially network policies and storage access rights.
