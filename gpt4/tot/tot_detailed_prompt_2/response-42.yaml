# Adding Services for both deployments

      targetPort: 80

# Each step here reflects iteration and improvement based on previous inputs. Corrected the base64 issue with the secret and completed the networking part with the services.
```
This final configuration includes the creation of PersistentVolumeClaims for MySQL data preservation, Security implementation via Secrets, and Deployment and Service configuration for both MySQL and WordPress. It also properly corrects the secret for MySQL passwords with a more complex example and includes network access configurations necessary for both components to communicate properly.
