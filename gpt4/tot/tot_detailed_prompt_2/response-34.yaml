# Expert 2 - Refinement and Review
# Reflection on Expert 1's response:
# The initial setup is sound, but there are aspects recommended for improvement:
# - Password for MySQL could be generated more securely and not hardcoded even in development. Using Kubernetes secrets generator or an external secret manager is advisable.
# - MySQL image is an older version; using the latest GA release or specifying a more recent tag might be preferable for support and features.
# - The resources request for MySQL PVC can be adjusted based on expected usage to ensure proper resource allocation.

# Expert 3 - Additional Improvements and Final Touches
# Considerations based on previous experts:
# - Fine-tuning container resource limits for both WordPress and MySQL to ensure efficient use of cluster resources.
# - Adding liveness and readiness probes to deployments to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy instances and to facilitate smoother rollouts and rollbacks.
# - Implementing more granular RBAC rules if needed, depending on the organization's security policy and cluster configuration.
# - Using a more explicit version number for WordPress and perhaps considering a non-root configuration for enhanced security.
