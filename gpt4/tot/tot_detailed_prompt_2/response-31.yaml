```yaml
# Expert 1: Let's start by creating the basic structure for the MySQL deployment in the Kubernetes YAML. 
# We'll first define the PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL to ensure data persistence. I'll add a 
# basic claim with a standard storage class and a request for 1Gi of storage.

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

# Expert 1: Now, I'll move on to the MySQL Deployment. We'll need a container named "mysql", using the 
# official MySQL image. For now, I'll use the version 5.7. We'll also need to bind the PersistentVolumeClaim 
# we defined earlier.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: mysql-root-password
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc

# Expert 2: Great start by Expert 1 on the MySQL part! I noticed that the MySQL 
# Deployment snippet is missing environments for the database to initialize it properly.
# We should define a Secret to store the MySQL root password securely. I’ll add that.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  mysql-root-password: base64_encoded_password

# Expert 2: Now, let's define the MySQL service to expose it within the cluster.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql

# Expert 3: Thanks, Expert 2, for incorporating the Secrets and the Service. Now, let’s construct the
# WordPress Deployment. Following the approach and structure shared by the other experts, I'll introduce
# a Deployment set for the "wordpress" container along with a corresponding Service and ConfigMap.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: mysql-root-password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: dbname

# Expert 3: Additionally, creating a Service for WordPress to make it accessible.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress

# Expert 3: Lastly, we need a ConfigMap for non-sensitive data like database name.

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  dbname: wordpress_db

# Expert 2: That wraps up our configuration. This setup should ensure both WordPress and MySQL
# Deployments are robust with all necessary components, ranging from storage, security with Secrets,
# and configuration via ConfigMaps and Services for interconnectivity. This should be ready for deployment.
```
