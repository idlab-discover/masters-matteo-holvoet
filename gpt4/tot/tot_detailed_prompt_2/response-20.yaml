# Expert 2 acknowledges the good start and then adds the ConfigMap and Secret:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ= # Base64 encoding of the desired password
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wp-config
data:
  HOST: mysql
  NAME: wordpress
  USER: root
  PASSWORD: password

# Expert 3 adds corrections and continues with the WordPress Deployment manifest:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:

        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wp-config
              key: HOST

          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:

            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wp-config
              key: PASSWORD

# Expert 1 proposes Service definitions for each application:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: mysql
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: wordpress

# Expert 2 observes that the manifest is complete and validates interaction:
# "Looks like we covered all bases. Deployments for both Wordpress and MySQL are well-configured along with their services. Persistent data requirements and security aspects are properly addressed using Secrets and ConfigMaps. Great teamwork in integrating all those components in a systematic way!"
