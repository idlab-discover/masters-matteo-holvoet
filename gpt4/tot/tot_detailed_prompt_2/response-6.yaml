# Expert 1: Let's start by defining a simple PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL. We need to ensure data persistence for the MySQL database.

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

# Expert 2: Building on what Expert 1 has defined, I will introduce the MySQL Deployment. I’ll ensure we utilize the PersistentVolumeClaim and introduce a Secret for the MySQL password, which isn't defined yet but we will get to it shortly.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc

# Expert 3: Continuing on the work of Experts 1 and 2, let’s now create the Secret referenced in the MySQL deployment for the database password, and also start building the ConfigMap that will be needed for the WordPress deployment.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: <base64-encoded-password>

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  database_name: wordpress
  user: wordpress
  password: <base64-encoded-password>
  hostname: mysql

# Expert 1: Thank you, Expert 3, for setting up the Secret and ConfigMap. Now, I'll take care of the WordPress Deployment, including the environment variables from the ConfigMap. I'll ensure WordPress contacts the correct MySQL service.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: hostname
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: database_name
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: user
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: password

# Expert 2: To finish up, let's add the Services for both WordPress and MySQL. This will help in networking between the pods and external access for WordPress.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer

# Expert 3: The manifests look good now! We've covered persistent storage, secure password management, and appropriate networking. Plus, the environment settings for WordPress are correctly referencing the ConfigMap and Secret. Well done team!
