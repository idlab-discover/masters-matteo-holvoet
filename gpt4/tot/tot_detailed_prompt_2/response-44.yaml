**Expert 1:**

Let's start by defining the basic skeleton for our Kubernetes manifest. We need two main deployments: one for WordPress and another for MySQL. Additionally, services are required to enable networking between pods and with external users.

First, focusing on the WordPress deployment: WordPress needs to be a container named "wordpress". For simplicity, let's use the official image `wordpress:latest`. This container will need to communicate with MySQL, so it'll require environment variables to configure the database connection. 

Given the need to keep sensitive data safe, we should also consider using Kubernetes Secrets for storing the MySQL database password. Moreover, since configuration changes might be needed without altering the main deployment YAML, we should employ ConfigMaps for non-sensitive data.

Let's draft this up for consideration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
  WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  mysql-root-password: base64encodedpassword
  mysql-password: base64encodeduserpassword

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: mysql-password
```

Excellent starting point! Now, let's flesh out the MySQL deployment. As MySQL is stateful, we need a PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence. This is crucial for database integrity and durability across pod restarts.

For security, the root password and user password are stored in the Secret as you have started. The use of a PersistentVolumeClaim ensures data isn't lost when the deployment is updated or pods are rescheduled.

Here's an extension of the YAML to include the MySQL deployment and its service, building on what you started:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: mysql-root-password
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: mysql-password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

Wonderful build-up, both of you! I'd like to clean up a minor clarification in the ConfigMap usage - everything else looks remarkably well-set.

For setting the MySQL service as `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST` in ConfigMap, let's ensure that the consistent naming convention across the manifest is maintained. Moreover, implementing a tidy labeling strategy could assist with any future selection operations or for applying networking policies.

Here is a final tweak for clarity and consistency:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: "mysql"  # Consistent reference to the MySQL service name.
  WORDPRESS_DB_USER: "wordpress"
```

This should seamlessly link the WordPress deployment configuration to the MySQL service, facilitating smooth internal communication over the correct database port. With these Kubernetes resources appropriately defined, we have established a robust and secure foundation for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend. Well done!
