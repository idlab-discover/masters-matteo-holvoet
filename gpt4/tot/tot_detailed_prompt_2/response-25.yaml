**Expert 1:**

To begin with, let's outline the setup for such a deployment in Kubernetes:

1. **Deployment for MySQL:**
   - Since databases require a persistent storage to preserve data even after a pod gets restarted, Kubernetes' PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is necessary here.
   - Name the container `mysql`.
   - Use the official MySQL image.
   - Set up secrets to handle the MySQL password securely.

2. **Deployment for WordPress:**
   - Name the container `wordpress`.
   - Utilize the official WordPress image which will connect to the MySQL server.
   - Declare environment variables through a ConfigMap for dynamic configuration, specifically for database hostname, port, and database name.
   - WordPress also requires a PVC for managing media content and ensuring that data isn’t lost when the pod restarts.

3. **Services**:
   - Internal ClusterIP services for both WordPress and MySQL so that they can communicate internally within the cluster.

4. **ConfigMaps and Secrets:**
   - Use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive data (e.g., database name, user, etc.).
   - Secrets should manage sensitive information such as passwords.

Here’s a rough sketch of how the manifest might look, starting with the ConfigMap and Secret for MySQL. I will also create a placeholder for the MySQL PVC.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mysql-config
data:
  MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
  MYSQL_USER: user

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-config
              key: MYSQL_DATABASE
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-config
              key: MYSQL_USER
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
---
```

Let’s stop here for now, to ensure I started off correctly, and to provide a point where others can contribute, particularly focusing on the WordPress setup and the respective services deployment.

**Expert 2:**

Great start, Expert 1! I appreciate the configuration using a ConfigMap and Secret for the MySQL deployment. Now, I'll extend the setup to include the WordPress deployment part, where we'll emphasize connecting WordPress to MySQL using the environment variables defined in a ConfigMap. Also, I'll define appropriate SVCs for both WordPress and MySQL:

Continuing the YAML with WordPress deployment and services:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-config
              key: MYSQL_USER
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-config
              key: MYSQL_DATABASE
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pv-claim

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: ClusterIP
  
---
```

Here, I've set up the WordPress deployment to connect to MySQL using environment variables populated from the ConfigMap and Secret we defined earlier. I’ve also set up basic ClusterIP services for both WordPress and MySQL to allow them to communicate internally. This approach will facilitate external access to WordPress while keeping MySQL interactions internal.

**Expert 3**: 

Thank you, Expert 2, for extending the infrastructure setup with articulate deployment configurations for WordPress and its connectivity. The use of ConfigMaps and Secrets is spot-on, ensuring that sensitive data is managed securely while allowing easy updates to non-sensitive configuration.

Additionally, your inclusion of Services for both applications to facilitate communications and resource management within the cluster is crucial. However, I would suggest a small edit. For the MySQL service, setting `clusterIP: None` designates it as a Headless Service, which is usually not necessary unless you need a stable network identity for the pods or are not load-balancing at the network level. If MySQL does not require any specific pod addressing, we can simply opt for a standard ClusterIP service. Here’s that minor but essential modification:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
---
```

This change will ensure that MySQL can still be robustly managed and accessed within the cluster without the added complexity of a Headless Service, simplifying network configurations and potentially reducing overhead.

With this structure, we have a complete and robust configuration for deploying a WordPress site with a MySQL backend in Kubernetes, including deployments, persistent storage, and secure management of both configuration data and sensitive credentials, all facilitated by appropriate Kubernetes objects like ConfigMaps, Secrets, PVCs, Deployments, and Services.
