Expert A: Let's start by creating the Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database. Firstly, we'll need two Deployments: one for WordPress and one for MySQL. We'll also create corresponding Services for network connectivity. To handle configuration data and sensitive information, we'll use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive data and Secrets for sensitive credentials like database passwords.

Here's an outline of what the YAML file segments will consist of:
1. ConfigMap for WordPress configuration settings.
2. Secret for MySQL credentials.
3. Deployment and Service for MySQL.
4. PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL data persistence.
5. Deployment and Service for WordPress.

I'll begin with the ConfigMap and Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  # Configuration data that is safe to store in a config map
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql-service
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: base64encodedpassword
  MYSQL_DATABASE: base64encodeddatabase
  MYSQL_USER: base64encodeduser
  MYSQL_PASSWORD: base64encodedpassword
```

Expert B: That's a solid start by Expert A. I'll continue by adding the MySQL Deployment and PersistentVolumeClaim. It's important that we ensure the PVC is properly specified to preserve the MySQL database state independent of pod lifecycle.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_DATABASE
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_USER
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_PASSWORD
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

Expert C: Thank you, Expert B, for detailing the MySQL deployment and PVC. I'll now define the WordPress Deployment and Service, referencing the WordPress ConfigMap and ensuring proper connection to the MySQL service through environment variables. We should also expose WordPress via a Service to allow inbound network traffic.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_USER
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_PASSWORD
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_DATABASE
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: wordpress
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: mysql
```

Expert A: Fantastic input, Experts B and C. This comprehensive manifest covers all requirements: Deployments with appropriate configurations, Services to connect WordPress and MySQL, and usage of ConfigMaps and Secrets for managing configuration and sensitive data. We need to ensure that everything is properly base64 encoded in the Secrets as required by Kubernetes. Great teamwork!
