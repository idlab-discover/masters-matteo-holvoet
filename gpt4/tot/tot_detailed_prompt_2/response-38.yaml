# Expert 3:
# Nicely built on each other's contributions! Both the MySQL and WordPress setups are fundamentally correct. I would like to make a small tweak to improve security by ensuring the MySQL Service is not accessible from outside the cluster. The existing service definition already does this by setting the type to `ClusterIP`, which is default and does not need to be explicitly mentioned. Additionally, we might also want to add resource requests and limits to the containers to ensure that they have guaranteed resources and do not overwhelm the node they're running on. Here could be an example for the WordPress deployment:

        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "200m"

# At this point, our YAML files are comprehensive and include high-level management of both applications. We enabled communication between WordPress and MySQL through environmental variables and secrets, ensured persistence in MySQL through PVCs, and managed network traffic.

# The final improvement made by adjusting resources encapsulates an essential aspect of real-world application deployments: ensuring application reliability and performance. Now, the manifest is ready for initial testing in a development environment.
