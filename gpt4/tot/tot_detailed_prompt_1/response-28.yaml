Given the complexity and structured approach requested, let me break down the Kubernetes YAML manifest creation into steps as the experts would contribute.

### Step 1: Define Initial Resources and Structure

**Expert A**: 
Start by defining the ConfigMap to store configuration details which are not sensitive. The ConfigMap can include MySQL details which WordPress needs to connect to the database:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mysql-config
data:
  mysql_host: "mysql-service"
  mysql_database: "wordpress"
  mysql_user: "wordpress_user"
```

**Expert B**: 
Define the Secret to store sensitive information such as MySQL password. Secrets are stored in an encoded form in Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  mysql_password: <base64-encoded-password>
```

**Expert C**: 
Design initial deployment YAML for MySQL with a PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence. This part sets up the MySQL database that will be used by WordPress:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-secret
                key: mysql_password
          - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
            value: wordpress
          - name: MYSQL_USER
            value: wordpress_user
          - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-secret
                key: mysql_password
        volumeMounts:
          - name: mysql-storage
            mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
        - name: mysql-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pv-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

### Feedback Sharing

**All Experts Agree**:
All experts review STEP 1 and provide a thumbs up. They agree on the completeness and correctness of this initial setup. This setup ensures connectivity between WordPress and MySQL through internal configurations and maintains security for sensitive data using Secrets. They agree to proceed to the next step to configure the WordPress Deployment and Services.

### Step 2: Completing the Setup with WordPress Deployment and Services

**Expert A**:
Setup the WordPress deployment with environment configurations pulling from the ConfigMap and the Secret requisites:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:php7.4-apache
        env:
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: mysql-config
                key: mysql_host
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
            value: wordpress
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
            value: wordpress_user
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-secret
                key: mysql_password
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80
```

**Expert B**: 
Define the Services necessary for connecting both WordPress and MySQL. External access to WordPress will be provided through the WordPress Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

### Consolidation and Submission

**All Experts Agree**:
Upon review and consolidation, all experts find that each bit of the manifest interconnects appropriately, managing configurations, secrets, deployments, services, and data persistence correctly. They agree to finalize this combined manifest as the complete solution.
