### Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect

#### Step 1: Define the Deployment for WordPress
- **Thought Process**: Start by defining a Deployment for WordPress. Use the WordPress image from Docker Hub. Bind the container port `80` for HTTP traffic. Define necessary environment variables for database configuration such as `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST`, `WORDPRESS_DB_USER`, `WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD`, etc., to connect to the MySQL backend.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql-service
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-user
              key: username
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-user
              key: password
```

#### Step 2: Define the Deployment for MySQL
- **Thought Process**: For MySQL, configure a separate Deployment using the MySQL image, exposing the default MySQL port `3306`. Ensure data persistence by mounting a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-root
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

#### Step 3: Configure Services for Connectivity
- **Thought Process**: Next, define Service objects for both WordPress and MySQL to enable connectivity. The WordPress service should expose port `80` and MySQL service port `3306`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
```

#### Step 4: Use ConfigMaps and Secrets for Configuration and Sensitive Data
- **Thought Process**: Define Secrets for MySQL user credentials and root password. Create a ConfigMap if there are non-sensitive configurations to manage.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-user
type: Opaque
data:
  username: d3B1c2Vy # base64 for "wpuser"
  password: d3BwYXNz # base64 for "wppass"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-root
type: Opaque
data:
  password: cm9vdHBhc3M= # base64 for "rootpass"
---
```

### Expert Analysis

- **Expert 1**: Described detailed step-by-step configurations with appropriate reasons.
- **Expert 2**: Focused mainly on scaling and robustness without much detail on how to implement the basic requirement.
- **Expert 3**: Offered an alternative approach using stateful sets but lacked clarity on services and configuration specific details.

### Scoring
- Expert 1: 5 (clear and precise steps)
- Expert 2: 3 (useful for scaling but lacks initial setup detail)
- Expert 3: 3 (good for specific scenarios but overly complex)

### Best Guess Solution
Based on the thorough analysis and direct answers to the question requirements, Expert 1's approach is most fitting and should be adopted for creating the Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with MySQL backend.
