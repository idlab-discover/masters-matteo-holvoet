### Expert 1: Kubernetes Administrator
#### Step 1: Design Deployment for MySQL
**Analysis**: We need to ensure the MySQL deployment has PersistentVolumeClaims to maintain the data even when the container restarts or is moved. Using the `mysql:5.7` image should be stable for this purpose. The container should be named "mysql".
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-persistent-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer
#### Step 1: Design Deployment for MySQL
**Analysis**: Apart from ensuring Persistence, other crucial aspects include defining resource requests and limits to prevent excessive resource usage. Also, incorporating lifecycle management hooks could assist with graceful shutdown and startup processes.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "200m"
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

### Expert 3: Cloud Solutions Architect
#### Step 1: Design Deployment for MySQL
**Analysis**: MySQL's sensitive data handling should involve using Kubernetes Secrets. It's imperative to map the root password from secrets to the environmental variables. Additionally, ensuring the Services and ConfigMaps cater to discovery requirements.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-pvc
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-pvc
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```
