Below are the analyses and thought processes of three different experts on how to create a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database as specified.

### Expert 1: DevOps Engineer

**Step 1: Create a ConfigMap for WordPress configuration**
- **Thinking**: ConfigMap to handle WordPress configurations not sensitive, such as database host which can be defined through the service name.
- **Sharing**: Created ConfigMap with key `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST` mapping to MySQL service name.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
```
**Score my peers**: Expert 2 - 5, Expert 3 - 4

**Step 2: Create a Secret for sensitive data**
- **Thinking**: Use Kubernetes Secrets to store sensitive information such as the database user and password to ensure these are not exposed in plain text.
- **Sharing**: Created a Secret managing sensitive data like username and password.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_USER: d3JvcmRwcmVzcw==
  MYSQL_PASSWORD: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: cm9vdHBhc3N3b3Jk
```
**Score my peers**: Expert 2 - 5, Expert 3 - 5

### Expert 2: Kubernetes Architect

**Step 1: Define ConfigMap for non-sensitive WordPress configurations**
- **Thinking**: Creating a ConfigMap that specifies static configurations required by WordPress, such as the host of the MySQL database.
- **Sharing**: Proposed a ConfigMap for defining expected non-sensitive configurations.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
```
**Score my peers**: Expert 1 - 5, Expert 3 - 4

**Step 2: Define Secret for MySQL credentials**
- **Thinking**: Kubernetes Secrets should be used to store credentials, which minimizes the risks of exposure and provides ease of management.
- **Sharing**: Drafted a Kubernetes Secret setup to store MySQL credentials securely.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_USER: d3JvcmRwcmVzcw==
  MYSQL_PASSWORD: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: cm9vdHBhc3N3b3Jk
```
**Score my peers**: Expert 1 - 5, Expert 3 - 5

### Expert 3: Application Developer

**Step 1: ConfigMap for application customization**
- **Thinking**: ConfigMap will facilitate the quick configuration of WordPress by setting predictable environment variables, priming it for first use.
- **Sharing**: ConfigMap design to ease the application configuration process.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
```
**Score my peers**: Expert 1 - 5, Expert 2 - 5

**Step 2: Use of Secret for environment-sensitive data**
- **Thinking**: Protection of sensitive data using Kubernetes Secret, allowing it to be injected into the deployment securely and kept apart from the codebase.
- **Sharing**: Setup a Secret for housing sensitive credentials away from the main configuration.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_USER: d3JvcmRwcmVzcw==
  MYSQL_PASSWORD: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: cm9vdHBhc3N3b3Jk
```
**Score my peers**: Expert 1 - 5, Expert 2 - 5

**Consensus and Final Analysis:**
All experts agree on the structure and components needed for the Kubernetes manifest for configuring and securing the WordPress and MySQL environments using ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data respectively. The similarity in their approaches also confirms the consensus to move forward with the configuration they proposed. Next steps involve creating the deployments and services as per the original question.
