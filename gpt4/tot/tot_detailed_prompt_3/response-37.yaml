### Step 1: Define the structure of the manifest file.

#### Expert 1 - Kubernetes Architect

Expert 1 describes how to structure the YAML file by breaking the deployment into two main components: the WordPress deployment and the MySQL database deployment. They outline creating two Deployment configurations for the WordPress app and the MySQL server, respectively. Both configurations would include respective Service manifests to allow network communication. Furthermore, Expert 1 suggests using a ConfigMap for non-sensitive data and a Secret for sensitive data such as database passwords.

Score by peers:
- Expert 2: Score 5 (Logical structure and appropriate use of Kubernetes objects)
- Expert 3: Score 5 (Offers a comprehensive approach touching all requirements)

#### Expert 2 - DevOps Engineer

Expert 2 focuses on the specifics of the Kubernetes manifest, stressing the importance of defining the right environment variables within the WordPress deployment to link it correctly with MySQL. They also emphasize the need to properly configure the PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence for MySQL. They suggest leveraging a LoadBalancer Service type for WordPress to expose it to the internet and a ClusterIP Service for MySQL for internal accessibility.

Score by peers:
- Expert 1: Score 4 (Strong operational insight, slightly less detail on other configuration aspects)
- Expert 3: Score 4 (Practical infrastructure focus, but lacking detail on actual YAML components)

#### Expert 3 - Cloud Solutions Architect

Expert 3 explains the idea of security and maintenance, focusing on the use of Secrets to store MySQL credentials safely and discussing the implications of update strategies in Deployments for long-term reliability. Given each component's interdependent nature, they highlight the importance of lifecycle management between WordPress and MySQL using Kubernetes health checks and readiness probes.

Score by peers:
- Expert 1: Score 3 (Focused on advanced practices, but did not cover basic YAML definitions intensively)
- Expert 2: Score 4 (Good integration of security and maintenance, but missed specific steps in initial setup)

### Consensus and Best Guess Solution

The combined input from all experts provides a comprehensive view for drafting the Kubernetes YAML manifest. Each expert contributed from their strength, giving a well-rounded approach to the deployment that includes practical, architectural, and operational perspectives. The consensus leads to a solution incorporating the detailed steps highlighted by Expert 1 and Expert 2 for the manifest structure and deployment configurations, enriched by the security and maintenance insights by Expert 3.

Creating the manifest involves:
1. Defining the Kubernetes Deployments and Services for both WordPress and MySQL.
2. Utilizing ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration.
3. Leveraging Secrets for storing sensitive data securely.
4. Configuring PersistentVolumeClaims for MySQL data persistence.
5. Appropriately exposing the services using different Service types.

The final YAML manifest effectively captures the deployment architecture ensuring security, scalability, and maintainability of the WordPress site backed by a MySQL database.
