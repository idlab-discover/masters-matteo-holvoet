For the question of creating Kubernetes YAML manifests for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database, let's involve three types of experts that would typically be well-suited for this task: DevOps Engineer, Cloud Architect, and Kubernetes Engineer. Each of these experts is well-versed in Kubernetes but offers a slightly different focus and breadth of understandings relevant to configuring and deploying services in scalable cloud environments.

Let's start by outlining the initial response from each of the experts on how to approach the creation of these manifests.

### Step 1: Initial Manifest Design

#### DevOps Engineer:
The DevOps Engineer begins by outlining the core components required, focusing on practical implementation:
- **Deployment for WordPress:** This includes setting up a Docker container running WordPress, configuring environment variables for database connection strings, and exposing the necessary port.
- **Deployment for MySQL:** This involves configuring a second Docker container specifically for MySQL, setting up PersistentVolumeClaims for data durability, and defining initial environment variables for database setup.
- **Services:** Suggests setting up Kubernetes Services for both deployments to handle networking within the cluster.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets:** Recommends using a Kubernetes Secret to store sensitive information like the MySQL password and a ConfigMap for non-sensitive configuration such as database name and user.
  
##### Manifest Sketch:
```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
...
```
Score: 5

#### Cloud Architect:
The Cloud Architect emphasizes a strategic approach focusing on scalability and security:
- Talks about the importance of defining resource requests and limits to ensure that the deployments are operating efficiently and resiliently under different load conditions.
- Highlights networking configurations, especially how to configure the Services to work effectively in a cloud environment that may be spanning multiple availability zones.
- Discusses the use of Kubernetes Secrets in greater depth for security.

##### Manifest Sketch:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: BASE64_VALUE
...
```
Score: 4

#### Kubernetes Engineer:
The Kubernetes Engineer drills into specific Kubernetes features and best practices:
- Specifies the Kubernetes versions and apiVersions for each resource, ensuring compatibility and best practice usage.
- Provides details on how to structure the YAML files for maximum readability and maintenance.
- Suggests leveraging advanced features like readiness and liveness probes in the WordPress deployment to ensure service reliability.

##### Manifest Sketch:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec: 
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
...
```
Score: 5

### Peer Review Scores and Continuation:
Here, both the DevOps Engineer and Kubernetes Engineer scores a 5, indicating a high feasibility of their approaches. The Cloud Architect scores a 4, reflecting a slightly lesser focus on practical implementation details but still a strong, valid approach.

As they are all judged to likely provide correct implementations, they would continue to collaboratively develop and refine the Kubernetes YAML manifests, eventually incorporating all mentioned aspects into a cohesive deployment plan.

### Conclusion:
Pooling expertise from DevOps, Cloud Architecture, and Kubernetes-specific skills provides a thorough and practical approach to deploying WordPress and MySQL on Kubernetes. It involves not just running the services but ensuring they are secure, maintainable, and ready for scale.
