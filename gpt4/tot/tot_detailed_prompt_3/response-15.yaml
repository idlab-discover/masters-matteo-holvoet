### Expert A - Kubernetes DevOps Specialist

#### Step 1: Analyze Requirements
- To deploy WordPress and MySQL on Kubernetes, we need two separate deployments with associated PersistentVolumeClaims, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.
- WordPress needs environment variables pointing to MySQL.
- MySQL will use a Secret to store database credentials.

**Step Analysis:**
Expert A outlines the fundamentals and acknowledges the need for Secrets and environment variables, which are crucial for integrating WordPress and MySQL.

#### Step 2: Writing Manifest for MySQL Deployment
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-secret
                key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

**Step Analysis:**
Detailed manifest YAML outlines both the deployment and the PVC. Correctly uses secrets for MySQL's root password.

#### Step 3: Create Secret and ConfigMap
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # base64 encoded password
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-configmap
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
  WORDPRESS_DB_USER: root
  WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: password
```

**Step Analysis:**
The provision of MySQL's password through a Secret and DB information through a ConfigMap is correct but the password should not be included as plain text even in encoded form here.

### Expert B - Cloud Architect

#### Step 1: Analyze Requirements
- Consider security and scalability in the deployments. 
- Ensure configurations are easy to update and manage via ConfigMaps and Secrets.

**Step Analysis:**
Emphasizes on security and scalability but lacks detailed required components explanation like the previous expert.

#### Step 2 & 3: Write ConfigMap, Secret, and volume claims
Suggests steps similar to Expert A but with additional emphasis on scalability settings like auto-scaling provisions which aren't explicitly required here.

### Expert C - Application Developer

#### Step 1: Discuss Application Requirements
Notes on integration between MySQL and WordPress would need environment variables to communicate correctly.

#### Step 2 & 3: Deployment Manifests
Focuses on the application integration, similar in deployment descriptors but less detailed in Kubernetes-specific configurations like persistent volumes and secrets.

---

**Scoring among Experts:**
- Expert A: 5 for all steps (detailed and accurate Kubernetes-centric approach).
- Expert B: 3 - provided good insights but missed some specifics (scaling not required at this stage).
- Expert C: 4 - good application focus but less infrastructural detail.

---

**Consensus and Conclusion:**
Expert A provides the most accurate and comprehensive Kubernetes configuration for deploying WordPress with MySQL. Adopt Expert A's approach as the consensus solution, ensuring correct and secure deployment using Kubernetes best practices.
