### Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect

**Step 1:** Begin by defining the MySQL Deployment including a PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence.

**Analysis:** In a production environment, MySQL should have a reliable storage option to ensure data is not lost in case of a pod failure. I'll create a PersistentVolumeClaim and link it to the MySQL deployment with appropriate access modes and storage capacity.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

**Step 2:** Set up the WordPress Deployment including environment variables that connect it to the MySQL service.

**Analysis:** WordPress will need environment variables to link it to the MySQL pod using its service name and port. The image version and port should be specified to match common WordPress configurations; here, I select a PHP-apache based image.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:php7.4-apache
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql:3306
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: username
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
```

**Step 3:** Configure Services for both WordPress and MySQL.

**Analysis:** Services need to be set up to allow communication between pods and external access to the WordPress site. MySQL service will target port 3306 and WordPress service will target port 80.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30000
```

**Step 4:** Define ConfigMaps and Secrets to hold configuration and sensitive data.

**Analysis** : Secrets are essential for storing sensitive data like database passwords securely, while ConfigMaps can store configuration data that is not sensitive. This allows for easier management and changes without impacting other parts of the deployment.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: bXlzcWx1c2VyCg==
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQK

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mysql-configmap
data:
  my.cnf: |
    [mysqld]
    sql_mode=NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
```

### Analysis of All Experts

- **Expert 2: DevOps Engineer** might focus on automation and CI/CD integration, proposing YAML adjustments for Helm charts for scalability and reusability. Would score high on modern practices and scalability.
- **Expert 3: Senior Developer** could emphasize application connectivity and environment configurations, ensuring the WordPress and MySQL interactions are highly optimized and secure.

**Final Solution:** Combining the robust definitions of deployment and persistence from the Kubernetes Architect (Expert 1) with the nuanced insights into automation from the DevOps Engineer (Expert 2) and the application-level configurations from the Senior Developer (Expert 3) would yield a comprehensive, robust, and efficient deployment of WordPress and MySQL on Kubernetes. The consensus involves adhering primarily to the Kubernetes Architect's detailed setup while integrating automation and application-specific configurations from the other experts.
