### Step 1: Define the Structure of the Kubernetes YAML Manifests

**Expert 1 - Kubernetes Deployment Specialist:**
We need two Deployments, one for WordPress and one for MySQL. Both Deployments should manage their respective containers. For MySQL, we need PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence across pod restarts. ConfigMaps will be used for non-sensitive environment configuration, while Secrets will handle sensitive data like database credentials.

**Expert 2 - DevOps Engineer:**
The first step is to set up the Deployments correctly. Both WordPress and MySQL require their specific Docker images. For WordPress, environment variables such as the database name, user, and password (through Secrets) are essential. For MySQL, ensuring a PersistentVolumeClaim is linked properly to persist data is critical. Both need Services for network access.

**Expert 3 - Kubernetes Security Expert:**
My approach focuses on ensuring that the Deployments are secure and follow best practices. Security involves configuring the MySQL deployment properly with secrets to store sensitive data like passwords. Both Deployments will need proper network policies (not just Services but how they are exposed). Using ConfigMaps for environment variables in WordPress links back to the database settings without revealing sensitive information.

#### Comments and Scoring:
- **As Expert 1**: I score Expert 2 a 4 for correctly emphasizing the importance of Docker images and Env vars, and Expert 3 a 5 for highlighting the importance of security.
- **As Expert 2**: I score Expert 1 a 4 for a correct structural overview and Expert 3 a 5 for focusing on security, which is often overlooked.
- **As Expert 3**: I score Expert 1 a 4 for general accuracy but missing specific security details, and Expert 2 a 4 as well since security could have been emphasized more.

### Step 2: Detailed Definition of Kubernetes Objects in YAML

      storage: 1Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080
  selector:
    app: wordpress
---
apiVersion: v1

```

**Expert 2 - DevOps Engineer:**
Expert 1's manifest is comprehensive. It integrates ConfigMap for environment variables and a Secret to handle sensitive MySQL password data. The deployment ensures each application component communicates securely. The inclusion of PVCs for MySQL ensures data retention. 

**Expert 3 - Kubernetes Security Expert:**
Expert 1 provided a secure and well-structured definition, noting especially important elements like the use of ConfigMaps, Secrets, and PersistentVolumeClaims. The services correctly expose the necessary ports, ensuring connectivity. I recommend defining NetworkPolicies for additional restrictions on pod communications for enhanced security.

#### Comments and Scoring:
- **As Expert 1**: I score Expert 2 a 5 for recognizing the importance of integrated communication and data retention, and Expert 3 a 5 for emphasizing advanced security measures.
- **As Expert 2**: I grade Expert 1's implementation a 5, as it meets all specified requirements effectively, thus ensuring functionality and security.
