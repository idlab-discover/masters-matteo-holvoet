#### Step 1 - Designing MySQL Deployment and PersistentVolumeClaim

The MySQL deployment must adhere to best practices for stateful applications:
- Use of a `PersistentVolumeClaim` ensures that the data can persist across pod restarts.
- Properly configure environment variables via a Secret (passwords) and ConfigMap (other configs) to customize the MySQL instance.
- Ensure the Service is set to ClusterIP to internalize database communications.

My MySQL Deployment YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

#### Step 1 - Designing Both Deployments and Persistent Storage for MySQL

While designing the deployment, attention is needed on separation of concerns:
- MySQL data should be separated using PersistentVolumeClaims.
- WordPress connects to MySQL with credentials stored in Secrets.
- ConfigMaps should handle non-sensitive configuration.

Proposed MySQL configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: standard
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-persistent-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

#### Step 1 - MySQL with Persistent Storage and Configurations

For MySQL:
- Secure MySQL deployment using Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive information.
- PersistentVolumeClaim to ensure data longevity.
- Deployment strategy that emphasizes simplicity and security.

Configuration for MySQL:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: fast
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-data
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Analysis and Scoring
Each expert has provided a solid foundation for the MySQL deployment incorporating best practices around data persistence and security through the use of PVCs, Secrets, and standard image versions.

- **Expert A**: Scores a 5 for strong adherence to conventional designs and clarity.
- **Expert B**: Scores a 5 as well but proposes a significantly higher storage request.
- **Expert C**: Also scores a 5 for covering all critical aspects but uses the latest MySQL image which might introduce unwanted changes upon updates.
