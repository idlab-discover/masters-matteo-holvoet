Let's begin this exercise by going through the scenario step by step with each expert providing their input at each phase.

### Step 1: Creating the MySQL Deployment with PersistentVolumeClaim

**Expert #1 (Database Architect):**
The MySQL container should use a Deployment and a PersistentVolumeClaim for ensuring data durability across pod restarts and failovers. Adopting a standard MySQL image, the deployment should configure the environment variables like MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_USER, and MYSQL_PASSWORD using Kubernetes secrets for security. 

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7 # Using version 5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: root-password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: database-name
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: database-user
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: database-password
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

**Peer Review Scores:**
Expert #2: 5
Expert #3: 4

**Expert #2 (Kubernetes Engineer):**
The configuration largely aligns with best practices for deploying stateful applications like databases on Kubernetes. However, ensuring the storage class for the PVC is defined or using a default one provided by the cluster should be highlighted for production deployments.

**Expert #3 (Security Specialist):**
The database architect has correctly utilized secrets for sensitive data. Itâ€™s also crucial to ensure those secrets are managed securely, possibly recommending the use of a secret manager.

### Step 2: Creating the WordPress Deployment

**Expert #2 (Kubernetes Engineer):**
For the WordPress part, a deployment should use an official WordPress image and configure the environment to connect to the MySQL database using values from secrets and config maps for non-sensitive data like database host and port.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql:3306
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: database-name
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: database-user
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: database-password
```

**Peer Review Scores:**
Expert #1: 5
Expert #3: 4

**Expert #3 (Security Specialist):**
This configuration ensures that Wordpress is using the correct database credentials and connecting to the MySQL service securely. The separation of sensitive and non-sensitive data is good practice.

**Expert #1 (Database Architect):**
The Kubernetes Engineer's approach to WordPress deployment is sound, making sure to connect it to the MySQL service without hardcoding sensitive information is key. Deployment settings should potentially scale as needed.

### Summary and Consensus:

Each expert has done well in their focused areas. Both the configurations for MySQL and WordPress are largely accurate and follow Kubernetes best practices in terms of security, deployment strategy, and data management. The combined insights from all experts would lead to a robust deployment strategy for a WordPress site backed by a MySQL database on Kubernetes.

**Final Analysis:**
The panel of experts agrees on the deployments of both WordPress and MySQL with secure and scalable configurations. The involvement of ConfigMaps, Secrets, and PersistentVolumes in the solution ensures operational efficiency and security, which makes the provided solution highly feasible for real-world application.
