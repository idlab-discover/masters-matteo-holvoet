### Step 1: Define the Structure of the Manifests

**Expert 1 (Kubernetes Engineer):**
"The first step is to structure our deployment ensuring all the required components are included: Deployments for WordPress and MySQL, Services for network connectivity, ConfigMaps for WordPress configurations, and Secrets to safely manage MySQL credentials. We’ll create separate sections for each component within the YAML file."

**Expert 2 (DevOps Specialist):**
"I suggest starting by mapping out the dependencies and prerequisites, such as volumes for MySQL. We then define the Deployments and Services. For security reasons, managing MySQL credentials via Secrets is crucial and must be integrated from the beginning."

**Expert 3 (Security Analyst):**
"My approach prioritizes secure storage of sensitive data. I'd recommend defining Secrets first to ensure they are ready for use in the MySQL Deployment. Post this, setting up the ConfigMaps for WordPress to make it configurable, and then creating the Deployments and Services."

**Scores:**
- Expert 1 scores a 4 by Expert 2 and a 4 by Expert 3: Secure but could integrate configurations and secrets earlier.
- Expert 2 scores a 5 by Expert 1 and a 5 by Expert 3: Comprehensive and security-conscious.
- Expert 3 scores a 5 by Expert 1 and a 5 by Expert 2: Security-forward, ensuring foundational elements are secure.

### Step 2: Define Configuration and Secrets

**Expert 1 (Kubernetes Engineer):**
"We define a Secret for MySQL credentials using base64 encoding. This will be referenced in the MySQL deployment. A ConfigMap for WordPress should include database name, user, and other non-sensitive configurations linking with environment variables from the secret." 

**Expert 2 (DevOps Specialist):**
"Creation of a Secret for MySQL credentials is crucial, we should carefully choose the keys like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD. For the ConfigMap, the values like MYSQL_DATABASE should be stored and later referenced in the WordPress deployment to maintain consistency."

**Expert 3 (Security Analyst):**
"First, ensuring the Secret is properly created with required keys like MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD. All sensitive data should be base64 encoded. For the ConfigMap, including the database host (service name of MySQL) will ensure that WordPress can locate the database."

**Scores:**
- Expert 1 scores a 4 by Expert 2 and a 3 by Expert 3: Solid try, but lacks the inclusion of host in ConfigMap.
- Expert 2 scores a 4 by Expert 1 and a 4 by Expert 3: Comprehensive, but slightly misses integration points.
- Expert 3 scores a 5 by Expert 1 and a 5 by Expert 2: Very focused on security and connectivity.

### Step 3: Deployments and Services Design

**Expert 1 (Kubernetes Engineer):**
"Both WordPress and MySQL need Deployments with respective containers specified and PersistentVolumeClaims for MySQL. Services must target the right ports; MySQL defaults to 3306 and WordPress to 80. Environment variables in WordPress deployment will reference ConfigMaps and Secrets."

**Expert 2 (DevOps Specialist):**
"Deployments should ensure WordPress and MySQL run smoothly. MySQL’s Deployment must integrate with the PersistentVolumeClaim for data longevity. For WordPress, environment variables must capture database details from ConfigMaps and Secrets accurately for a successful connection."

**Expert 3 (Security Analyst):**
"Ensuring the MySQL Deployment uses the defined Secret for credentials and mounts a PersistentVolumeClaim. WordPress’s Deployment needs to securely inject environment variables from both ConfigMaps and Secrets. Services need to ensure correct port configuration for network policies."

**Scores:**
- Expert 1 scores a 4 by Expert 2 and a 4 by Expert 3: Strong, but could emphasize security specifics.
- Expert 2 scores a 4 by Expert 1 and a 4 by Expert 3: Good, but missing detailed security aspects.
- Expert 3 scores a 5 by Expert 1 and a 5 by Expert 2: Excellent coverage of security and configuration integrity.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all steps and scores, the consensus leans heavily towards Expert 3's approach, emphasizing secure management and detailed connectivity configurations throughout the setup process. The focus on security and thorough integration of components makes Expert 3’s approach the most viable for setting up a WordPress website with a MySQL backend using Kubernetes.
