### Step 1: Define the Requirement & Initial Setup

**Expert A - Kubernetes Engineer:**
We need to deploy a WordPress site with a MySQL backend using Kubernetes. This includes two Deployments, two Services, PersistentVolumeClaims for MySQL, ConfigMaps, and Secrets. The first step is to create a ConfigMap for MySQL and a Secret for sensitive credentials.

**Expert B - DevOps Engineer:**
The task requires setting up the complete architecture using Kubernetes, where persistence, security, and configuration need to be managed efficiently. I suggest starting with the creation of the MySQL Deployment with a PersistentVolumeClaim to ensure data persistence.

**Expert C - Cloud Architect:**
To make this deployment, the important components involve managing data persistence, secure handling of credentials, and internal network communication. We begin by defining Secrets and ConfigMaps to store sensitive data and configuration settings respectively.

### Scoring Analysis of Step 1:
**Expert A's Score**: 4 (good overview, practical start with config management)  
**Expert B's Score**: 3 (focused well on persistence, slightly out of sequence as ConfigMaps/Secrets are prioritized)  
**Expert C's Score**: 4 (similar to A, good focus on foundations of deployment)

### Step 2: Creating Kubernetes Manifests

**Expert A - Kubernetes Engineer:**
Here is the YAML for the MySQL Secret, ConfigMap, and Deployment including PVC:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root_password_base64
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mysql-configmap
data:
  DB_HOST: mysql
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

**Expert B - DevOps Engineer:**
I suggest modifying the MySQL deployment to include readiness and liveness probes to ensure the container is healthy and operational before and while in traffic. This improvement helps in maintaining service reliability:
```yaml
  containers:
  - name: mysql
    image: mysql:5.7
    readinessProbe:
      tcpSocket:
        port: 3306
      initialDelaySeconds: 15
      periodSeconds: 10
    livenessProbe:
      tcpSocket:
        port: 3306
      initialDelaySeconds: 30
      periodSeconds: 10
```

**Expert C - Cloud Architect:**
Next is the Deployment and Service file for WordPress:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-configmap
              key: DB_HOST
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30000
  selector:
    app: wordpress    
```

### Scoring Analysis of Step 2:
**Expert A's Score**: 5 (comprehensive YAML covering all needed aspects for MySQL)  
**Expert B's Score**: 4 (useful addition of probes but needs full context)  
**Expert C's Score**: 5 (well-constructed YAML for WordPress including environmental configurations)

### Final Analysis:
Both experts A and C provided comprehensive solutions covering different components, and B focused on improving reliability through probes. The combination of their inputs gives a well-rounded and complete deployment scenario. The consensus is to proceed with the detailed configurations provided by these experts, forming a secure, resilient, and maintainable WordPress deployment on Kubernetes.
