### Expert 1: Kubernetes Administrator

#### Step 1: Initial Setup
- **Thinking**: Start by defining the deployments for both WordPress and MySQL. Each deployment should manage its respective container. For WordPress, use the official WordPress image and expose the standard port 80. For MySQL, use the official MySQL image.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: wordpress
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: wordpress
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: wordpress
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
          env:
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
            value: mysql
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-user
                key: username
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-pass
                key: password
  ```

- **Sharing with group**: Focused on ensuring the deployment of WordPress contains correct image and ports, and integrates environment variables for DB connectivity through secrets.

### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

#### Step 1: Initial Setup
- **Thinking**: Setup starts by creating two separate deployments and services for both WordPress and MySQL. I would use Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data, respectively. MySQL would need a PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: mysql
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: mysql
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: mysql
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:5.7
          ports:
          - containerPort: 3306
          env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-root-pass
                key: password
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
            name: mysql-storage
        volumes:
        - name: mysql-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pvc
  ```

- **Sharing with group**: Emphasized the MySQL deployment specifics, particularly how it handles data persistence and security.

### Expert 3: Cloud Architect

#### Step 1: Initial Setup
- **Thinking**: Consider the overall architecture, ensuring components like secrets, configmaps, and services mesh well together. Create a robust and secure system by tying environment variables in WordPress to secrets storing MySQL credentials and ensuring services are correctly defined to facilitate communication.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: wordpress
  spec:
    type: LoadBalancer
    ports:
    - port: 80
    selector:
      app: wordpress

  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: mysql
  spec:
    ports:
    - port: 3306
    selector:
      app: mysql
  ```

- **Sharing with group**: Explained the need for defining Kubernetes services to ensure connectivity between containers and the external world.

### Analysis and Scoring

**Expert 1**’s response is focused and directly addresses the specifics for the WordPress deployment, incorporating environment variables and security efficiently. **Score: 5**

**Expert 2** provides a detailed look at the MySQL deployment, particularly the use of persistent storage which is crucial for stateful applications. The security aspect with secrets is well integrated. **Score: 5**

**Expert 3** bridges the initial setups with the necessary interfaces for communication, essential for overall system functionality, though there's a slight lack of detail in the specifics of configuration management via ConfigMaps. **Score: 4**

### Conclusion
Combining the strengths of each expert’s contribution, the comprehensive solution covers all aspects defined in the question. Expert 1 and 2 provide solid bases for the deployments with security and persistence, while Expert 3 fills the gaps by integrating the necessary services. This blending forms a robust approach to deploying a WordPress website backed by a MySQL database on Kubernetes.
