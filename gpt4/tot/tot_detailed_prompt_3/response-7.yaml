### Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect

**Step 1: Define Deployment for MySQL**
- **Analysis:** We need a deployment for MySQL which will include its specific container configuration. The data should persist across pod restarts or failures. Thus, using PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is crucial. The MySQL image will be specified, along with volume mounts that link to the PVCs.
- **YAML Creation Thought Process:**
  1. Define a Deployment resource, set metadata and name it "mysql".
  2. Use the mysql image.
  3. Set the volume mount within the container spec and link this to PVC.
  4. Provide an environment variable via ConfigMap and Secrets (credentials).

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-config
              key: database
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

**Step 2: Define PVC for MySQL**
- **Analysis:** We need a PVC specification to claim the storage required by MySQL. It should match the volume storage requirements.
- **YAML Creation Thought Process:**
  1. Define PersistentVolumeClaim.
  2. Specify access modes and storage capacity.

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

**Step 3: Define Service for MySQL**
- **Analysis:** A service needs to be created to enable network access to the MySQL deployment within the cluster.
- **YAML Creation Thought Process:**
  1. Define Service.
  2. Specify selector to link to the deployment.
  3. Define the ports to be exposed and protocol used.

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
```

**Step 4: Define Deployment for WordPress**
- **Analysis:** WordPress requires access to the MySQL database. Configuration will be passed via ConfigMaps and Secrets.
- **YAML Creation Thought Process:**
  1. Define a Deployment resource for WordPress.
  2. Use environment variables to configure database access and link to MySQL.
  3. Define the port WordPress will be running on.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql-service:3306
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: db_user
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: db_name
```

**Step 5: Define Service for WordPress**
- **Analysis:** Similarly, WordPress needs a service to enable external access.
- **YAML Creation Thought Process:**
  1. Define Service.
  2. Specify selector.
  3. Define the type as NodePort to enable external access.

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: NodePort
```

### Analysis and Consensus
All experts provide critical and operationally relevant information. Each focuses on core aspects of the deployment at differing depths aligned with their expertise:

- **Expert 1 (Kubernetes Architect)** provides a well-rounded base manifest configuration.
- **Expert 2 (DevOps Engineer)** emphasizes operational excellence and security.
- **Expert 3 (Cloud Solutions Architect)** adds on scalability, performance, and environment-specific considerations which might be crucial for optimizing the deployment based on contextual needs.

**Consensus Solution:**
Combining Expert 1â€™s comprehensive-base YAML configurations with the operational security insights from Expert 2, and integrating the scalability and performance enhancements suggested by Expert 3, would provide a robust solution for a Kubernetes deployment of a WordPress site backed by MySQL. This would not only ensure functionality but also optimize for security, scalability, and cost-efficiency depending on the deployment environment (on-premises vs cloud). Additionally, as each expert used and built upon the foundations laid by their predecessor, this incrementally constructed solution should be technically sound and practically implementable.
