## Expert 1: Kubernetes Engineer

### Step 1: Defining the base structure for Deployments and Services.

**Thinking**: We will need two deployments: one for WordPress and one for MySQL. Each deployment will have a corresponding service to expose it.

**Manifest Construction**:
- For WordPress, we use the official image, expose port 80, and set necessary environmental variables with references to ConfigMaps and Secrets.
- For MySQL, use the official MySQL image, expose the MySQL port, and attach a PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence.

**Peer Review Score**: -

### Step 2: Configuring Persistent Volume Claim for MySQL

**Thinking**: A PersistentVolumeClaim is needed for MySQL to ensure data persists beyond pod lifecycle. We define a standard storage class and request sufficient storage space.

**Manifest Construction**:
- The PersistentVolumeClaim would include specifications like access modes and storage capacity.

**Peer Review Score**: -

### Step 3: Utilizing Secrets and ConfigMaps

**Thinking**: Sensitive data like the database password should be managed via Secrets, whereas other configuration data can use ConfigMaps.

**Manifest Construction**:
- Create a Secret for the MySQL root password.
- Create a ConfigMap for WordPress to configure its connection to MySQL.

## Expert 2: DevOps Specialist

### Step 1: Initial Setup and Base Configuration

**Thinking**: Start by setting up the basic framework for the deployment and service of both WordPress and MySQL applications. This ensures they are isolated and manageable.

**Manifest Construction**:
- Mirror Kubernetes Engineer's deployments but focus on scalability and management features like liveness and readiness probes.

**Peer Review Score**: -

### Step 2: Data Management Configuration

**Thinking**: Emphasize not just on PersistentVolumeClaim, but also data security and potential backup strategies.

**Manifest Construction**:
- Make sure the data volume is encrypted and secure access policies are defined.

**Peer Review Score**: -

### Step 3: Configuration Management

**Thinking**: Ensure that the configuration is flexible and easy to update without downtime.

**Manifest Construction**:
- Setup additional environment variables via ConfigMaps that allow tuning of both WordPress and MySQL without redeployment.

## Expert 3: Cloud Architect

### Step 1: Architectural Overview

**Thinking**: Focus on a resilient and highly available architecture.

**Manifest Construction**:
- Similar to others but include specifications for multi-zone deployment and considerations for failover.

**Peer Review Score**: -

### Step 2: Persistent Storage Strategy

**Thinking**: Beyond just claiming storage, how does it integrate with cloud-provider offerings and data recovery mechanisms?

**Manifest Construction**:
- Specify different storage classes depending on performance requirements.

**Peer Review Score**: -

### Step 3: Security and Compliance

**Thinking**: Focus heavily on security, ensuring compliance with enterprise or regulatory frameworks.

**Manifest Construction**:
- Use Kubernetes RBAC policies in addition to Secrets and ConfigMaps.

**Peer Review Score**: -

**Analysis**:
All three experts provide valid and complementary views, reflecting the multi-faceted approach required for Kubernetes deployments. The combined approach:
- Uses sound Kubernetes deployment strategies from the Kubernetes Engineer for practical application deployment.
- Incorporates the robust operational practices and additional insights into security and maintenance from the DevOps Specialist.
- Benefits from the high-availability and security-focused architectural viewpoint of the Cloud Architect.

The consensus solution integrates each of their strengths for a well-rounded Kubernetes YAML manifest aimed at deploying a WordPress website backed by a MySQL database.
