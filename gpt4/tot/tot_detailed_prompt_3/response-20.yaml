### Step 1: Create MySQL Deployment with PersistentVolumeClaims and Service

**KIA's Analysis**:
- Define a Deployment for MySQL specifying the container name as "mysql".
- Use a PersistentVolumeClaim to ensure data durability across Pod recreations. A standard storage class and a claim size fitting typical MySQL usage should suffice.
- Set necessary environment variables through a Kubernetes Secret for MySQL credentials to enhance security.
- Configure a Service of type ClusterIP for MySQL as it only needs to be reachable internally.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
```

**DOE's Analysis**:
- Similar to KIA, but emphasizes choosing a more updated version of MySQL for compatibility with newer client libraries.
- Suggests adding readiness and liveness probes to the MySQL deployment to ensure the service remains healthy and to facilitate automatic recovery.

**AD's Analysis**:
- Focuses on the connection requirements from the application side, ensuring that the database URL and credentials are correctly exposed to the WordPress deployment for use.
- Mentions configuring the deployment for ease of later upgrades and maintenance.

**Scoring**:
- KIA's Response: 5 (because it comprehensively covers all necessary aspects with industry standards)
- DOE's Response: 5 (adding the aspect of probes is essential for production environments)
- AD's Response: 4 (less focus on Kubernetes specifics but critical points on application integration)

### Step 2: Create WordPress Deployment and Service

**KIA's Analysis**:
- Define a Deployment for WordPress specifying the container name as "wordpress".
- Connect WordPress to MySQL through environment variables using values from ConfigMaps and Secrets.
- Expose WordPress through a Service of type LoadBalancer to allow public access.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
  WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress_db

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer
```

**DOE's Analysis**:
- Suggests using a specific version of WordPress for better version control and compatibility testing. Highlights the importance of security practices by restricting unnecessary permissions and by using updated images.
- Recommends setting resource requests and limits to ensure that the WordPress container is allocated enough resources without overloading the Kubernetes node.

**AD's Analysis**:
- Discusses user experience and the application's performance metrics, suggesting the use of caching plugins for WordPress and the addition of a CDN for improved load times and scalability.

**Scoring**:
- KIA's Response: 5 (complete and accurate setup according to specifications)
- DOE's Response: 5 (important addition of best practices for real-world applications)
- AD's Response: 4 (useful from an application perspective, slightly less focused on the Kubernetes specifics)

### Conclusion:
All three experts provide valuable insights from different perspectives. Thus, a composite solution incorporating aspects from all three analyses could be considered the best practice approach. This includes:
- Robust, scalable MySQL and WordPress deployments with health checks and resource management.
- Application-level considerations for performance and user experience, ensuring the solution is not only technically sound but also optimally configured for real-world use.
