### Step 1: Draft the MySQL Deployment with Persistence

#### Expert A (Kubernetes Engineer)
1. **Drafting the MySQL Deployment:**
   - Define a `Deployment` for MySQL.
   - Use the official MySQL image.
   - Configure a `PersistentVolumeClaim` to ensure data persistence.
   - Create a `ConfigMap` for MySQL configurations and a `Secret` for storing sensitive data such as passwords.

   **Thinking:** MySQL needs reliable storage for data persistence, so a `PersistentVolumeClaim` is necessary. Using a `Secret` is essential for security, especially for database credentials.

2. **Peer Evaluation:**
   - **Expert B:** Scores 5 (Alignment with best practices for database deployment in Kubernetes.)
   - **Expert C:** Scores 5 (Correct deployment strategy and use of Kubernetes resources.)

#### Expert B (DevOps Specialist)
1. **MySQL Kubernetes YAML Configuration:**
   - Use a `Deployment` resource. Set up a pod with a single MySQL container.
   - Integrate environment variables pulling from a `Secret` for sensitive information.
   - Attach a `PersistentVolumeClaim` for long-term storage, ensuring data isn't lost across pod recreations.

   **Thinking:** Persistent storage is crucial for any database; hence, the configuration of a `PersistentVolumeClaim` is essential. The environment variables will fetch database credentials securely from a `Secret`.

2. **Peer Evaluation:**
   - **Expert A:** Scores 5 (Well-thought-out deployment and security considerations.)
   - **Expert C:** Scores 4 (Approach is robust but requires clear implementation details in YAML.)

#### Expert C (Cloud Architect)
1. **Designing MySQL Deployment:**
   - Utilize the MySQL image from Docker Hub.
   - Set up a `PersistentVolumeClaim` for data durability.
   - Deploy using a `Deployment` with necessary resource requests.
   - Secure database credentials using a `Secret`.

   **Thinking:** Itâ€™s critical to emphasize not just the durability but also the performance and security. Including resource requests can prevent the MySQL pod from being overwhelmed by resource demands.

2. **Peer Evaluation:**
   - **Expert A:** Scores 5 (A comprehensive deployment strategy, well-aligned with best practices.)
   - **Expert B:** Scores 5 (Acknowledges the importance of secure and persistent storage.)

### Consensus after Step 1:
All experts agree on the general deployment architecture for MySQL featuring a `Deployment`, usage of `PersistentVolumeClaim` for storage, and `Secrets` for sensitive data management. All scores are high, indicating strong agreement and likelihood of these approaches being correct.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim

    - ReadWriteOnce

        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

In the subsequent steps, each expert will continue to outline the remaining elements, including the WordPress Deployment, Services, and additional configurations, following this pattern of drafting, evaluation, and consensus building.
