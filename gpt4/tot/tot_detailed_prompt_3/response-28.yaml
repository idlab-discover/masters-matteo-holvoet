### Expert 1: Kubernetes Educator

#### Step 1: Defining the Structure of the YAML File
**Thinking**: The first requirement is to structure our YAML file defining both the WordPress and MySQL deployments. Given the specifications, we will need to create a Deployment for each, Services for network access, and we should leverage ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configurations and sensitive data appropriately. 
**Analysis**: 
- Deployment for WordPress should include the WordPress image, and setup environment variables from ConfigMaps and Secrets.
- Deployment for MySQL should include the MySQL image and setup environment variables, mounting a PersistentVolume for data.
- Services for both to ensure they are accessible.
- ConfigMaps for environment variables like database host, user, etc. Secrets specifically for passwords.

#### Step 2: Creating ConfigMap and Secret 
**Thinking**: ConfigMaps can store configuration data as key-value pairs. For WordPress, we might need the database name, user, and host. For MySQL, potentially less because it might only need default configurations unless further customizations are specified. For sensitive data like the database password, use a Secret.
**Analysis**: 
- Create a ConfigMap containing non-sensitive data like database name, user, and host.
- Create a Secret to store the MySQL root password and WordPress database password.

### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

#### Step 1: Focusing on Service and Deployment Definitions
**Thinking**: Each application (WordPress and MySQL) needs to be managed through a Deployment for automation, scalability, and management. Services are crucial to provide stable networking, as they provide a single point of entry to the Pods.
**Analysis**:
- Define a Deployment for each, setting replicas, image, and resource requests.
- Define Services for each Deployment to route the traffic properly.
- For WordPress, expose port 80 or 443 depending on whether TLS will be used.
- For MySQL, typically, the service should be accessible only within the cluster, hence a ClusterIP service could suffice.

#### Step 2: Implementing Data Persistence and Configurations
**Thinking**: MySQL requires persistent storage to ensure that the data remains across Pod restarts. Using a PersistentVolumeClaim is therefore essential. ConfigMaps and Secrets will help manage configuration and sensitive data securely.
**Analysis**:
- Define a PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL.
- Use a ConfigMap for habitual configuration settings.
- Use Secrets for any sensitive information like passwords.

### Expert 3: Kubernetes Application Developer

#### Step 1: Designing the Application Configuration
**Thinking**: To configure WordPress and MySQL effectively, the deployment scripts must be personalized with environmental configurations. We must consider service discovery between the two applications.
**Analysis**:
- WordPress needs to be configured to connect to MySQL via environment variables.
- The MySQL service needs a stable network identifier that WordPress uses to connect.
- Both need proper container images specified in their deployments.

#### Step 2: Security and Data Management
**Thinking**: Data security and management in K8s is typically handled using Secrets for sensitive data and PersistentVolumes for data that needs to persist. Proper use of access policies in PersistentVolumeClaims ensures the security and integrity of the data.
**Analysis**:
- MySQL will use a PersistentVolumeClaim to ensure data persists beyond Pod lifecycle.
- Passwords and other sensitive pieces will be handled using Kubernetes Secrets.

### Consensus and Solution:
Given the detailed analyses provided by the experts, all three presented viable implementations that align with best practices. The consensus involves creating:
- A Deployment for WordPress and MySQL each.
- A Service for each application.
- A ConfigMap to manage environment variables.
- A Secret to manage sensitive data like passwords.
- A PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL data persistence.

Here is a Kubernetes YAML manifest example combining the consensus from all the experts:
