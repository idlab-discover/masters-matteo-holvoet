**Step 1: Write the basic structure of the Kubernetes manifest for a WordPress deployment**

**Expert 1 - Kubernetes DevOps Engineer:**
To deploy WordPress with MySQL on Kubernetes, we start by creating two separate deployments: one for WordPress and one for MySQL. Each deployment will have its respective containers named as required. First, for the WordPress deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
            value: mysql
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: wordpress-secrets
                key: username
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: wordpress-secrets
                key: password
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: wordpress-secrets
                key: database
```
Score for this response: 5, as it correctly sets up the WordPress deployment with appropriate ports and environment variables using secrets.

**Expert 2 - Kubernetes Security Specialist:**
Alongside configuring the WordPress deployment, it's crucial to initialize Secrets for securing database credentials and keep Configuration in ConfigMaps separate for better manageability:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: wordpress-secrets
type: Opaque
data:
  username: d29yZHByZXNz
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
  database: d29yZHByZXNzX2Ri

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
```
Score for this response: 5, because initializing secrets for sensitive data is a critical security step for Kubernetes deployments.

**Expert 3 - Cloud Solutions Architect:**
While deployments establish the containers needed, services are equally essential to ensure that the deployed containers can communicate not only internally but also with external resources if required. For WordPress and MySQL, we need to consider defining Kubernetes services:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```
Score for this response: 5 for correctly defining necessary services to expose the WordPress application and ensure connectivity for MySQL.

**Consensus after Step 1:**
All experts provided accurate responses for initial steps crucial in setting up WordPress with MySQL on Kubernetes. Each tackled essential parts of the deployment, hence all are retained to proceed to the next step with a score of 5 each.

Assuming continued detailed steps in this manner, monitoring responses, and adhering strictly
to Kubernetes best practices in configuration, secretion management, and networking would
unfold throughout subsequent steps. The process, structured around individual expert commentaries
and peer review scoring, ensures a comprehensive, secure, and optimum result in the final Kubernetes manifest setup. 

Experts would review initial service, deployment, secret, and configmap structures followed by tuning, security considerations, and performance optimization in further iterations.
