### Kubernetes YAML Manifest Creation for WordPress and MySQL

#### Step 1: Define Requirements and Initialize the YAML File

**DevOps Expert:**
The task is to create a Kubernetes manifest. We'll start defining two deployments (WordPress & MySQL) and their respective services. WordPress will communicate with MySQL, so MySQL credentials will be stored as secrets and other configurations as a ConfigMap.

**Database Architect:**
For MySQL, ensuring data persistence is crucial, which means configuring a PersistentVolumeClaim. The deployment will also need to set up parameters correctly for database access security and durability.

**Systems Analyst:**
We'll need to outline the environment where these applications will run, ensuring that the services are exposed correctly and the deployments are tuned for performance and reliability.

**Scoring:**
- DevOps Expert: 5 (clear understanding of Kubernetes objects)
- Database Architect: 5 (correct focus on persistence and security)
- Systems Analyst: 4 (good overall but vague on specific Kubernetes objects)

#### Step 2: Create MySQL Deployment and PersistentVolumeClaim

**DevOps Expert:**
```yaml
# MySQL Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-secret
                key: password
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
# MySQL PVC
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

**Database Architect:**
The MySQL deployment is ideal with the PersistentVolumeClaim. It ensures the data's durability across pod restarts or failures. The Recreate strategy is appropriate because it ensures no data corruption during the deployment's lifecycle changes.

**Systems Analyst:**
The setup seems robust, focusing on both accessibility and durability. It would be beneficial to further optimize parameters such as resource requests/limits for better performance management in different environments.

**Scoring:**
- DevOps Expert: 5 (created secure and resilient MySQL deployment)
- Database Architect: 5 (highlighted the importance of Recreate strategy and PVC setup)
- Systems Analyst: 4 (good additional focus on optimization)

#### Step 3: Create WordPress Deployment and Service

**DevOps Expert:**
```yaml
# WordPress Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql-service
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-secret
              key: password
# WordPress Service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

**Database Architect:**
Looks comprehensive, tying up with MySQL via service and password from secrets. The database service architecture is stable and ensures smooth interconnection for data exchanges.

**Systems Analyst:**
By deploying WordPress with the necessary environment variables pointing to MySQL, it ensures effective communication. A NodePort service type might be adequate for testing but for production, using a LoadBalancer would be preferable.

**Scoring:**
- DevOps Expert: 5 (appropriately configured WordPress deployment and service)
- Database Architect: 4 (good integration analysis but overlooked service types)
- Systems Analyst: 5 (correct advice on service types for different environments)

### Final Assessment:
- **Consensus Solution**: Use the setups described with detailed security, resiliency considerations, and an emphasis on connectivity and deployment strategies.
- **Alternate Considerations**: Review service types based on environment needs (development vs production) and further optimize resource allocations based on usage predictions.
