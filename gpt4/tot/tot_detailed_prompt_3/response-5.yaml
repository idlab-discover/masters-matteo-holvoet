### Step 1: Draft Initial Manifest for MySQL Deployment

#### Expert 1: Kubernetes Developer
**Analysis**: First, I believe we need a Deployment YAML for MySQL that uses a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for data storage, which ensures data persistence even if the Pod crashes. The Deployment needs to reference a Secret for sensitive data like the MySQL root password. MySQL will listen on its default port of 3306.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

#### Expert 2: Cloud Architect
**Analysis**: I agree with the use of PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL data storage; however, I would emphasize the importance of configuration options such as resource limits and requests. I would include MySQL version specification to ensure software version consistency.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "0.5"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "1"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

**Analysis**: Deploying the MySQL container with the configuration mentioned by the others is fundamental. An addition could be setting up liveness and readiness probes to ensure that the database service is always available and healthy.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        livenessProbe:
          tcpSocket:
            port: 3306
          initialDelaySeconds: 45
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          tcpSocket:
            port: 3306
          initialDelaySeconds: 45
          periodSeconds: 10
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

### Analysis and Solution Consensus
All experts are fundamentally correct in their approach to drafting the MySQL YAML manifests. To synthesize the best overall solution for a MySQL Kubernetes Deployment for a WordPress website, we should combine the best practices suggested:

1. Persistent storage through PVCs as mentioned by all.
2. Inclusion of secrets to manage sensitive information.
3. Usage of specific container image tags for reliability.
4. Resource requests and limits to manage the resource utilization.
5. Health checks to ensure MySQL is always operational. 

Combining the insights from all three experts drives us to create a robust and efficient MySQL deployment suitable for a production environment. We should use the elements from all three drafts, prioritizing performance, security, and reliability.
