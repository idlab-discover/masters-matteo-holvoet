**Expert 1: Kubernetes Deployment Architect**

**Step 1: Define Kubernetes YAML for MySQL Deployment**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```
**Step 2: Define PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

**Expert 2: Kubernetes Networking Specialist**

**Step 1: Define Service for MySQL and WordPress**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```
**Step 2: No additional actions required in this step for networking.**

**Expert 3: Kubernetes Security Specialist**

**Step 1: Define Secret for MySQL Password**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: <base64-encoded-password>
```
**Step 2: Define ConfigMap for WordPress Environment Variables**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
  WORDPRESS_DB_USER: root
  WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: mysql-password
```

**Consensus Building and Analysis**

- Expert 1 scores highly in step configuration and deployment knowledge, focusing on the backend MySQL deployment with persistent storage considerations. Score: 5
- Expert 2 provides critical insights into Kubernetes networking, ensuring services are appropriately configured to expose the applications. Score: 5
- Expert 3 emphasizes security with the use of Secrets for sensitive data and ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration, crucial for application security and configurability. Score: 5

**Conclusion**
Incorporating the expertise of all three experts ensures the necessary components of a WordPress deployment are addressed holistically:
- Expert 1's deployment manifest ensures MySQL has persistent storage and is correctly deployed.
- Expert 2's service configuration ensures both WordPress and MySQL are accessible as needed.
- Expert 3's security measures ensure sensitive data is adequately protected using Kubernetes secrets and ConfigMaps.

**Recommended YAML Manifests**: Combination of all expert inputs into a coherent YAML pipeline would provide a robust deployment strategy for WordPress with a MySQL backend, ensuring operational efficiency, security, and configurability.
