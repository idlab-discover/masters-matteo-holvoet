### Step 1: Outline the Basic Requirements

#### Expert A (DevOps Engineer)
**Thought Process:** Start by defining the basic elements of Kubernetes required for deploying WordPress and MySQL. We need two Deployments, two Services, a ConfigMap, and Secrets. Define the WordPress Deployment using an official image and expose the correct port. For MySQL, create a PersistentVolumeClaim to ensure data persistence and use a Service to allow WordPress to communicate with it.

**Written Analysis:**
```yaml
# Basic outline without specifics
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ...
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ...
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ...
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ...
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  ...
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  ...
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  ...
```

#### Expert B (Cloud Architect)
**Thought Process:** Highlight the dependency and connectivity between WordPress and MySQL, emphasizing the usage of environment variables in WordPress to connect to the MySQL server. Suggest the use of Secrets for MySQL credentials and a ConfigMap for tunable parameters that could be dynamic.

**Written Analysis:**
```yaml
# Focus on interaction
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ...
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  containers:
  - name: wordpress
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    env:
    - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
      value: mysql
    - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: mysql-secret
          key: MYSQL_USER
    - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: mysql-secret
          key: MYSQL_PASSWORD
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mysql
    image: mysql:5.7
    env:
    - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: mysql-secret
          key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
...
```

#### Expert C (Kubernetes Specialist)
**Thought Process:** Strategically use Kubernetes abstracted management features, such as ConfigMaps for non-sensitive data and Secrets for passwords or tokens. Define Services for both applications considering best practices such as using a ClusterIP for MySQL, as it does not need external exposure.

**Written Analysis:**
```yaml
# Focused on services and operational management
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
selector:
  app: wordpress
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
selector:
  app: mysql
---
...
```

### Next Steps
Review scores and feedback to decide who progresses and further refine the YAML manifests. Based on initial outlines, all experts are allowed to proceed to the next step of detailing specific configurations, e.g., persistent volume configuration, exact environmental variable setting, service specifics, etc.
