### Step 1: Define the YAML manifest for MySQL Deployment including PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence.

#### Expert A: DevOps Engineer
Thinking:
1. MySQL requires persistent storage for data, which means using a PersistentVolumeClaim.
2. Choosing `mysql:5.7` as the container image because it's stable and widely used.
3. Configuring Secrets for storing MySQL user, password, and database to ensure sensitive data is not hard coded in the YAML.

Proposed YAML snippet:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: database
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

#### Expert B: Kubernetes Architect
Thinking:
1. Emphasizes the security by introducing network policies (not specifically requested but generally a good practice).
2. Points out that adding readiness and liveness probes to MySQL could help manage container lifecycles better, improving availability.

Proposed YAML snippet:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: database
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

#### Expert C: Cloud Security Specialist
Thinking:
1. Focuses on ensuring that MySQL deployment includes security considerations such as using a non-root user and following the principle of least privilege.
2. Suggests also using encryption at rest for the PersistentVolume to enhance data security (not achievable directly through this YAML but should be configured at the cluster level).

Proposed YAML snippet:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 999
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: user
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: user-password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: database
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Peer Scoring:
- Expert A scores B as 4 (secure but lacks lifecycle management), C as 3 (security-focused but the complexity for this setup might be overkill).
- Expert B scores A as 5 (all necessary elements included), C as 4 (good security practices but not strictly required).
- Expert C scores A as 5 (sufficient for deployment), B as 4 (good additions but not requested).

### Analysis and Best Guess Solution:
Consensus seems to focus on the fundamental requirements with a slant toward added security measures. Combining security and lifecycle management practices is advisable but the overall solution must align closely with the provided guidelines.

Best Guess Solution:
Incorporate basic security measures and lifecycle management from B and combined insights of A and B for robust solution simplicity and effectiveness, including readiness/liveness probes and basic security practices without extending too much into configurations not requested (like Expert C's solution).
