**Step 1: Create MySQL Deployment with PersistentVolumeClaim**

I'll start with a Deployment for MySQL, as it's the backend and needs to be ready when WordPress starts. I would use the official MySQL image, select an appropriate storage size for the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), and utilize a Secret for storing MySQL credentials.

**MySQL Deployment and PVC**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-data
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

**Scoring**: Should assess validation based on correctness and comprehensiveness.

**Step 2 onwards**: Will be dealt with after peer evaluation of this step.

**Step 1: Initialize ConfigMap and Secret**

Before handling the deployments, setting up a ConfigMap for MySQL configurations and a Secret for sensitive credentials is crucial. This would allow both containers to be configured without hardcoding sensitive details in the YAML files.

**ConfigMap and Secret Definition**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: <base64-encoded-password>

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mysql-config
data:
  user: root
```

**Scoring**: Evaluation based on security practices and foresight regarding configuration management.

**Step 2 onwards**: Evaluation continues based on consensus.

### Kubernetes Expert 3: Systems Administrator

**Step 1: Outline Service Definitions for MySQL and WordPress**

Creating Services early would clarify the necessary ports and communication paths between components, helping to define the Deployment configurations appropriately.

**Services for MySQL and WordPress**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

**Scoring**: Judging the necessity and preparation of network communication setups.

Each expert now critiques their peers:

- **Expert 1** scores **Expert 2** (4) and **Expert 3** (3)
- **Expert 2** scores **Expert 1** (4) and **Expert 3** (4) 
- **Expert 3** scores **Expert 1** (5) and **Expert 2** (5)

Assuming satisfactory scores, the experts proceed to the next steps, building on each other's work and scoring until a consensus manifest, or a critical error prompting an expert's exit, shapes the final solution. 

**Final Analysis and Solution**: Merging the consolidated and positively reviewed elements from each expert after iterative development and peer validation leads to a complete Kubernetes manifest correct and optimized for deploying a WordPress site with a MySQL backend appropriately configured with storage, security, and network configurations.
