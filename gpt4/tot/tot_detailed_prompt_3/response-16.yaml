### Expert 1: Kubernetes Administrator

**Step 1: Design of the Kubernetes YAML manifest**
**Thinking:** Start with defining the structure of deployments for WordPress and MySQL including containers with specified names. For WordPress, select a stable image (e.g., `wordpress:latest`) and set the deployment to manage its lifecycle. Apply similar logic for MySQL, using the image `mysql:5.7`. Include PersistentVolumeClaims in MySQL deployment to manage data persistence. Define services for both applications to handle network traffic. Use ConfigMaps for configurable non-confidential data and Secrets for sensitive data like MySQL credentials.

**Step 2: Writing the manifest**
- **Services Definition:** Create standard services for both applications. WordPress at port 80 and MySQL at port 3306.
- **Deployment Configuration:** Apartments are configured with environment variables pulled from ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage database connections.
- **Persistent Data Management:** MySQL uses a PersistentVolumeClaim to ensure data is not lost on pod termination.

**Step 3: Ancillary Configurations**
- **ConfigMaps:** Store database name, user, and other non-sensitive configurations.
- **Secrets:** Use Kubernetes secrets to safely store MySQL password.

**Score:** Since this step involves intrinsic knowledge and practical application, I will score myself cautiously as 4, hoping for peer assessment for potential oversights.

### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

**Step 1: Design of the Kubernetes YAML manifest**
**Thinking:** I agree with the basic structure that Expert 1 proposed. Focus on leveraging Kubernetes' ability to automate deployment and scaling. Also, ensure that security best practices around using Secrets for sensitive information is accounted for.

**Step 2: Writing the manifest**
- **Deployment Details:** Ensure liveness probes and readiness probes are configured to manage the containers effectively.
- **Resource Allocation:** Define resource requests and limits to ensure that containers are allocated necessary resources within the cluster.

**Step 3: Security and Observability**
- **Security Contexts:** Specify security contexts for both deployments to enforce security policies.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement annotations for monitoring and integrate with cluster-level logging to facilitate observability.

**Score:** This expert combines Kubernetes best practices with a keen understanding of operational needs, deserving a 5.

### Expert 3: Cloud Architect

**Step 1: Design of the Kubernetes YAML manifest**
**Thinking:** Alignment with 1 and 2 but with an added emphasis on the flexibility of deployment configurations to support various environments such as development, staging, and production using Kustomize or Helm.

**Step 2: Writing the manifest**
- **Modular Design:** Each component—deployment, service, PVC, ConfigMap, and Secret—should be modular to facilitate reusability and environment-specific deployments.
- **Cross-Component Dependencies:** Explicitly declare dependencies, ensuring that configurations are loaded before the deployment starts, possibly using init containers or post-start hooks.

**Step 3: Deployment Automation and Scalability**
- **Auto-scaling:** Integrate Horizontal Pod Autoscalers for both MySQL and WordPress depending on the metrics like CPU and memory consumption.
- **Backup Strategies:** Include annotations for backup tools to recognize persistent volumes for MySQL for scheduled backups.

**Score:** A holistic approach, aligning scalability with architectural best practices rates a 4.

### Analysis and Consensus Solution:

All experts provided comprehensive designs for the WordPress and MySQL deployments with insightful emphasis on security, scaling, and the life cycle management typical of production-grade applications. The consensus leans towards a hybrid approach encompassing all three sets of expertise: robust deployment configurations (Expert 1), focus on operational and security best practices (Expert 2), and modular, scalable design catering to different environments (Expert 3).
