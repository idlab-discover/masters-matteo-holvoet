### Expert 1: Kubernetes Administrator

#### Step 1: Define the MySQL Deployment and Service
**Thinking**: MySQL will need a Deployment to ensure its pod is managed properly and a Service for consistent network access. We'll need a PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence to ensure data isn't lost when the pod is restarted. Sensitive information like passwords will be stored in Secrets.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: bXlzcWxwYXNz   # encoded password (example: mysqlpass)

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
```

#### Expert 2: Kubernetes Developer

#### Step 1: Define the MySQL Deployment and Service
**Thinking**: For the MySQL, we needs security for the password (via Secrets) and data persistence (using a PVC). This setup ensures MySQL state is preserved across pod recreation and provides secure access through environments.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: bXlzcWwtc2VjcmV0LXBhc3N3b3Jk   # 'mysql-secret-password' base64 encoded

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: standard
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-volume
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
```

#### Expert 3: DevOps Engineer

#### Step 1: Define the MySQL Deployment and Service
**Thinking**: Focusing on best practices with using Secrets for sensitive configs and a Persistent Volume for data retention. Using a structured labeling system aids in service targeting and management.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  root_password: c29tZS1yYW5kb20tcGFzc3dvcmQ=   # base64 for 'some-random-password'

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-data
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:8.0
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: root_password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-data

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  type: ClusterIP
```

### Analysis and Scoring of Step 1
- **Expert 1**: The solution provides a thorough approach with detailed configuration, including an example-secret encoding. Score: 5
- **Expert 2**: A clear configuration but assumes the default `storageClassName`, which might not be available in all clusters. Score: 4
- **Expert 3**: Good usage of best practices with version specification and structured labels but has given a very high PVC size which might not be necessary for most use cases. Score: 4

### Next Steps
This was only the first step in building the YAML manifests for a WordPress and MySQL application on Kubernetes. The next steps would be for each expert to move on to defining the WordPress Deployment and Service, using ConfigMaps for WordPress configuration, and establishing network rules and possibly ingress for access. Then they would test and validate the manifests in a real or simulated Kubernetes environment.
