### Step 1: Define Requirements and Basic Configuration for Kubernetes Manifests

#### Expert 1 (Kubernetes Engineer):
In this step, it is important to capture all requirements and begin translating them into Kubernetes concepts. Two deployments are needed: one for WordPress and another for MySQL. For WordPress, we use the `wordpress` image and expose the relevant port, typically 80. For MySQL, we use the `mysql` image and also require a PersistentVolumeClaim for data storage to ensure data persistence. Services are essential for enabling communication between pods and with the outside world. We should also incorporate ConfigMaps for dynamic configuration properties and Secrets to handle sensitive information such as MySQL passwords securely.

#### Expert 2 (DevOps Specialist):
The primary focus is on ensuring high availability and secure interactions between WordPress and MySQL. WordPress needs an environment variable for connecting to MySQL, provided through a ConfigMap or directly in the Deployment manifest. MySQL requires a PersistentVolumeClaim because database persistence is critical across pod recreations. Using a ConfigMap for MySQL settings (like character sets) and a Secret for passwords is necessary. Creating a Service for both applications ensures they can communicate internally and are reachable as needed.

#### Expert 3 (Cloud Solutions Architect):
For deploying WordPress effectively using Kubernetes, clear segmentation between compute resources (like containers) and storage (like volumes) is necessary, with a secure method for configuration. Ensuring that the WordPress deployment includes not only the appropriate image but also specific tags to lock the version for stability is key. For MySQL, besides the image and PersistentVolumeClaim, ensuring the database is initialized correctly with a Secret for the root password is crucial. Kubernetes Services should encapsulate each Deployment for isolation and controlled access.

          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-secret
              key: password
```

#### Expert 2 (DevOps Specialist):
```yaml
# Same initial YAML definitions as Expert 1 with added parts for Services and more detailed container configurations
```

**Expert 2's YAML Rating:**

#### Expert 3 (Cloud Solutions Architect):
```yaml
# Similar to Expert 1 but includes a descriptor on using specific version tags for images instead of 'latest'
```

**Summary of this step:** There's a consensus on incorporating version-specific tags and expanding configuration details for better init-container use and health checks. Expert 1's and 3's approaches to volumes and configurations are particularly noted.

### Final Analysis and Consensus Solution:
The consensus among experts leans towards a detailed yet stress-tested YAML configuration emphasizing security and efficiency. Expert 3's suggestion to use specific version tags over the 'latest' for better environment stability is agreed upon as the best practice. Thus, combining detailed init-container configurations, rigorous use of Secrets and ConfigMaps, and precise version control of images forms the best approach to deploying a robust WordPress site backed by MySQL in Kubernetes.
