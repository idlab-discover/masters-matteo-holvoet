## Expert 1: Kubernetes Solutions Architect

### Step 1: Plan the Deployment Structure and Configuration Storage
We need two deployments: one for WordPress and another for MySQL. For configuration, we should use a ConfigMap to store common configuration data, while sensitive information like database credentials will be stored in a Kubernetes Secret.

#### Analysis
Breaking down components logically and suggesting the use of ConfigMap and Secrets shows a secure approach to storing sensitive data, which is essential in production environments. This step is crucial for setting up a maintainable and scalable Kubernetes application.

## Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

### Step 1: Create Basic YAML Configurations
To start, the basic YAML files for the Deployments and Services of both WordPress and MySQL will be essential. These will include the necessary configurations but will initially not touch on the specifics of security or data management strategies.

#### Analysis
Focusing on building initial YAML configurations is a practical starting point. However, not immediately considering security or data management might lead to refactoring later.

### Peer Scores
Expert 1: 3  
Expert 3: 3

## Expert 3: Database Administrator

### Step 1: Focus on Database Security and Integrity
For the database backend which is MySQL, focus heavily on security aspects and data integrity. This includes using persistent volumes for data storage to ensure data survival during pod failures.

#### Analysis
The focus on security and data persistence from the start is crucial for databases, especially in production environments, ensuring data isnâ€™t lost and is secured against unauthorized access.

## Step Calculation and Result

Given the assessments and scores of all assumed steps:
1. Expert 1 scored highest consistently, showing a balanced understanding of security, maintainability, and practicality.
2. Expert 2 had a practical approach but lacked immediate focus on crucial aspects like security and data persistence.
3. Expert 3 was particularly focused on security and persistence, which while important, seemed to somewhat narrow the scope of initial setup.

The consensus solution would lean towards Expert 1's approach, which holistically considers the architecture including security from the start along with practical deployment setups.
