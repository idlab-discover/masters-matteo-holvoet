### Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect

**Step 1: Define the MySQL and WordPress Deployments**

Considering best practices, we start by defining separate Kubernetes deployments for MySQL and WordPress. This approach isolates management and scaling of each component.

- **MySQL Deployment**: Use the `mysql:5.7` image, configure environment variables from a secret (for DB credentials), and attach a PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence.
- **WordPress Deployment**: Use the `wordpress:latest` image, define required ports (80 or 443), and configure environment variables for database connection details (host, user, password) via a ConfigMap and a Secret.

**Step 2: Configure PersistentVolumeClaims for MySQL**

MySQL data needs to be persistent across pod restarts and failures.

- Create a PersistentVolumeClaim with a sufficient storage class and size to handle the database growth.

### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

**Step 1: Create ConfigMaps and Secrets**

For security and configuration management, utilize ConfigMaps for non-sensitive data and Secrets for sensitive data.

- **ConfigMap**: Contains database hostname, used by WordPress.
- **Secret**: Contains MySQL root password and WordPress database password, injected into deployments as environment variables.

**Step 2: Define Services**

Define Kubernetes services for both MySQL and WordPress to facilitate network connectivity.

- **MySQL Service**: A ClusterIP service to enable WordPress components to communicate with MySQL.
- **WordPress Service**: A LoadBalancer service to expose the WordPress site externally.

### Expert 3: Cloud Solutions Architect

**Step 1: Security Best Practices**

Focus on implementing security practices within the Kubernetes manifest.

- Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for accessing ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Deployments if in a shared environment. Minimal privileges for any service account attached to the deployments.

**Step 2: Monitoring and Health Checks**

Implement readiness and liveness probes in both deployments to ensure smooth operations and quick recovery from failures.

- **MySQL Readiness Probe**: Checks connection status.
- **WordPress Liveness Probe**: Checks HTTP status via a GET request.

### Analysis and Solution:

All experts agree on using separate deployments with ConfigMaps for configurations and Secrets for sensitive credentials. PersistentVolumeClaims for MySQL and services to expose and connect the deployments are common in their plans.

**Consensus Solution**:

```yaml
# MySQL Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:

        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc

# WordPress Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: db-host
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-secret
              key: user
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-secret
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

# MySQL and WordPress services, ConfigMap, and Secrets omitted intentionally but similar implementation based on agreed principles.
```

This YAML should be expanded with appropriate services, config data, RBAC policies, and PV definitions to meet actual production requirements.
