### Step 1: Each expert drafts the initial YAML configuration for the MySQL Deployment, including PersistentVolumeClaim.

#### Expert 1: Kubernetes Architect
The Kubernetes Architect begins by focusing on the requirements for data persistence in MySQL. They opt to operate with a PVC to guarantee that if the pod crashes, its data doesn't lose integrity or availability. This setup involves defining a `PersistentVolumeClaim` also for the actual schema and defining the deployment by setting necessary environment variables through Secrets, which is foreseen in the next steps.

Here is the proposed YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secrets
              key: root-password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-data
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

#### Expert 2: Database Administrator
The Database Administrator emphasizes the details regarding the MySQL tuning and proper database operation, proposing similar YAML with added annotations for maintenance perspectives and slightly altering resource requests based on their database sizing experience.

Suggested YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
  
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: user
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

#### Expert 3: DevOps Engineer
The DevOps Engineer concurs mostly with the initial deployment views but adjusts the volume setup and resource requests for better CI/CD pipeline integrations and scaling. Their proposal includes elaborate readiness and liveness probes understanding Kubernetes' dynamics.

Proposed YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-root-secret
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Peers' Scoring

Now, each expert scores the otherâ€™s responses. Based on the focus and depth given to Kubernetes' operational principles and practices, Expert 1 may score a 4 for Expert 2's added database optimizations and fine-tuning regarding storage, and a 5 for Expert 3's readiness for scale and pipeline integration. Similarly, Expert 2 might provide a 4 for both Expert 1 and Expert 3, favoring comprehensive deployment strategies, while Expert 3 may offer a 4 to Expert 1 for adhering to safe practices but a 5 to Expert 2 for a well-considered resource specification.

### Next Step

Experts continue developing further components such as ConfigMaps, Secrets relevant to environments, WordPress deployment specifics including environment variables, and finally services setup.

*After each step, the sequence repeats with assessments, followed by detailed discussions to arrive at a near optimal configuration.*
