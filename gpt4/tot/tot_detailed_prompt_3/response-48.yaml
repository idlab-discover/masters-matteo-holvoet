#### Step 1: Creating the MySQL Deployment and Persistent Volume Claim
Thinking: MySQL needs a Deployment and PVC for its storage. We use the official MySQL image, set environment variables via a Secret for security (like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD), and configure a persistent volume for data persistence through a PersistentVolumeClaim.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: bXlzcWxfc2VjcmV0X3Bhc3N3b3JkCg==  # Base64 encoded

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

#### Step 2: Creating the WordPress Deployment
Thinking: The WordPress container should connect to MySQL, thus environment variables for DB connection are needed, typically sourced from a ConfigMap for non-sensitive info and Secrets for sensitive data like passwords. The official WordPress image is used.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql:3306
  WORDPRESS_DB_USER: root

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpress-config
              key: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

#### Step 1: MySQL Setup
Thinking: Agree with deployment setup for MySQL. Persistent storage is crucial for database operations. Secrets for sensitive data is a security best practice.

Score for Expert 1: 5

#### Step 2: WordPress Setup
Thinking: The WordPress Deployment looks correct. Utilizing a ConfigMap for non-sensitive data and Secrets for passwords aligns with best practices in configuration management.

Score for Expert 1: 5

### Expert 3: Cloud Architect

#### Step 1: MySQL Design
Thinking: Proper use of PVC for data persistence and Secrets for sensitive data management are well handled. It's a robust design that ensures data durability and security.

Score for Expert 1: 5

#### Step 2: WordPress Configuration
Thinking: Configuration aligns well with best practices by separating sensitive and non-sensitive data management, using ConfigMap and Secret respectively. The deployment configuration efficiently instructs WordPress to connect to the MySQL service.
