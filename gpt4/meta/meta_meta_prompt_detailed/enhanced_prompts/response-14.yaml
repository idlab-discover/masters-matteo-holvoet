**Revised Prompt:**

"Develop a Kubernetes YAML manifest to orchestrate a WordPress website supported by a MySQL database, focusing on resilience and scalability. The manifest should adhere to the following sophisticated criteria:

1. **Container Configuration:**
   - Designate the names "wordpress" for the WordPress container and "mysql" for the MySQL container.
   - Construct a multi-container Deployment for WordPress integrating the latest stable WordPress image. Specify ports, and configure environmental variables to link with the MySQL database.
   - Elaborate a Deployment for MySQL utilizing the latest stable MySQL image, geared with a strategy for data persistence using PersistentVolumeClaims.

2. **Service and Networking Design:**
   - Implement Kubernetes Services for both WordPress and MySQL that not only facilitate basic connectivity but also consider load balancing. Detail your reasoning for choosing a specific service type (ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer) in the context of potential real-world application scenarios.

3. **ConfigMap and Secrets Management:**
   - Utilize ConfigMaps to externalize non-sensitive configuration details out of the application code. Define which configurations you decide to include and justify their externalization.
   - Employ Kubernetes Secrets for managing sensitive data such as database credentials. Provide a rationale for the security practices chosen to protect this data, including but not limited to encryption at rest and access policies.

4. **Problem-Solving Scenario:**
   - Introduce a hypothetical high-traffic event scenario where the current deployment must scale efficiently. Discuss how the Kubernetes resources like horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) and resource limits would be set up to handle this spike in traffic.

5. **Innovation and Best Practices:**
   - Encourage the proposal of an innovative feature or a best practice that could potentially enhance security, improve performance, or streamline deployment operations. Include a concise discussion on how this feature could be implemented and its expected impact.

The revised instructions should challenge conventional deployment strategies and promote a deeper understanding of Kubernetes' capabilities in managing resources, handling sensitive configurations, and ensuring application scalability and resilience. Finalize your proposal with a well-reasoned implementation plan that synthesizes information from software development, IT operations, and cybersecurity domains."

**Expected Outcome:**

- This revised prompt should encourage the user to think critically about the architecture and management of a typical web application within a Kubernetes environment.
- It should lead to a comprehensive exploration of Kubernetes' native features and third-party tools to enhance deployment strategies.
- Users are encouraged to integrate knowledge from diverse technical fields to craft a sophisticated, secure, and efficient deployment strategy.
- The prompt also motivates the articulation of innovative solutions, potentially pushing the boundaries of standard Kubernetes implementations.
