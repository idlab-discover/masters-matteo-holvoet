Revised Prompt:
"Design an advanced Kubernetes YAML manifest to set up a highly available WordPress website with a MySQL database, ensuring scalability and security. This manifest must meet the following intricate requirements:
    - Configure two interconnected containers within a single pod named 'wp-pod': one container for WordPress named 'wordpress', and another for MySQL named 'mysql'.
    - Create a Deployment configuration for WordPress that includes a customized image suitable for a high-traffic website, dynamic scaling parameters, and environment variables to facilitate seamless database connections.
    - Develop a MySQL Deployment that utilizes a PersistentVolume backed by network storage to ensure data durability across pod restarts and node failures, with read and write capabilities ensuring data consistency.
    - Illustrate how to implement Services for both WordPress and MySQL ensuring they support both internal and external accesses, with considerations for load balancing and secure access.
    - Integrate ConfigMaps to harmonize non-sensitive configuration across the deployments, whilst employing Kubernetes Secrets to manage sensitive information such as database credentials and WordPress configuration secrets securely.
    - Enhance the traditional deployment by describing how to configure health checks (liveness and readiness probes) for each container to maintain service reliability and availability.
    - Challenge convention by devising a strategy to automatically handle schema updates in MySQL when upgrading WordPress versions, considering rollback strategies in case of failed deployments.

Reflect on how each component in the configuration serves the broader goals of operational efficiency, security, and scalability. Discuss alternative strategies that could be employed and analyze their potential impacts on the system's robustness and performance. This complex exercise aims to deepen your understanding of Kubernetes' capabilities and encourage critical evaluation of deployment strategies in a cloud-native environment."
