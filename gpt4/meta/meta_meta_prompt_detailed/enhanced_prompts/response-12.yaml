Revised Prompt:

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to establish a WordPress site backed by a MySQL database, reflecting both practical deployment strategies and potential real-world complications. Include the following parameters and constraints in your solution:

1. Define two separate Deployments:
   - Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'.
   - For WordPress, select an appropriate container image, expose the necessary ports, and configure environment variables corresponding to MySQL settings.
   - For MySQL, implement a Deployment designed for data resilience using PersistentVolumeClaims.

2. Develop Services for both WordPress and MySQL to ensure interconnectivity and network resolution between them.

3. Utilize ConfigMaps for WordPress configurations and Secrets to manage sensitive data, such as database credentialsâ€”demonstrate how these Kubernetes objects increase security and manageability.

4. To elevate your configuration:
   - Integrate a multi-tier network policy that isolates the WordPress and MySQL pods but still allows necessary communications.
   - Embed a scenario where a sudden change in traffic predicts a need for dynamic scaling. Propose how to pre-configure Horizontal Pod Autoscalers based on hypothetical load increases.
   - Include error handling strategies, perhaps through readiness probes for WordPress and liveness probes for MySQL, which must address common failure scenarios in a high-load environment.

5. Critically analyze the potential single points of failure in the proposed Kubernetes setup and suggest enhancements or additional Kubernetes resources that could improve system reliability and efficiency.

6. Lastly, evaluate how your proposed deployment could be modified for different environments, for instance, a development versus a production environment, taking into consideration resource utilization and security implications.

The revised prompt should encourage a sophisticated analysis of Kubernetes applications, provoke strategic decision-making regarding deployment configurations, and foster innovative troubleshooting approaches."
