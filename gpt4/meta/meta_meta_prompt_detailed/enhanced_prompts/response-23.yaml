Revised Prompt:
"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to establish a robust and scalable WordPress website backed by a MySQL database. The deployment scenario should reflect the following advanced constraints and requirements:

    - Containers should be named distinctly as 'wordpress' for the WordPress service and 'mysql' for the MySQL service.
    - Construct a detailed Deployment configuration for WordPress, selecting optimal container images, and configure necessary ports alongside relevant environment variables for database communication. Justify your choice of the WordPress image.
    - Develop a Deployment plan for MySQL, integrating PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence. Analyze and explain the choice of the access mode and storage class within your PersistentVolumeClaims.
    - Engineer Services for both WordPress and MySQL to facilitate interconnectivity. Discuss the type of service you chose for each and rationalize how these choices affect the overall accessibility and security of the application.
    - Implement ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration details and sensitive data securely. Illustrate how you would organize these Kubernetes resources to maximize maintainability and security.
    
To deepen the analytical challenge, consider the following scenarios:
    - Your deployment must be capable of undergoing scaling without downtime. Outline your strategy for achieving this using Kubernetes features.
    - Assume a scenario where the MySQL database is heavily accessed. Propose a resource allocation strategy for both the database and the application pods to ensure optimal performance.
    - Address potential security vulnerabilities in containerized environments. Suggest Kubernetes-native solutions to secure the application and database layers from common attack vectors.

The expected outcome of this task is a Kubernetes YAML manifest that not only fulfills the technical requirements but also exhibits a strategic thought process behind the choices of configurations and scalability options. Discussion of the reasoning behind each decision is essential to foster a deeper understanding of Kubernetes' capabilities and best practices in deploying web applications."
