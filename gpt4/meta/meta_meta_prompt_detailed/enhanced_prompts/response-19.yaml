Revised Prompt:

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes deployment YAML manifest that facilitates the operation of a scalable WordPress website interconnected with a MySQL database. Your task involves several layers of complexity and requires careful consideration of both functionality and security. Specifically, address the following requirements and scenarios:

1. Name the WordPress and MySQL containers appropriately as per the configuration.
2. Structure a multi-container Deployment for WordPress that not only utilizes the latest suitable container images but also configures ports and environment variables optimally for database interactions. Justify your choices based on performance and security considerations.
3. Develop a Deployment strategy for the MySQL database that includes the use of Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to ensure data persistence. Evaluate different storage classes and choose the most appropriate one for a production-level database.
4. Create Kubernetes Services for both WordPress and MySQL to manage internal and external connectivity. Challenge conventional setups by proposing alternative networking strategies that could potentially enhance scalability or security.
5. Implement ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data. Propose an encryption method for Secrets and rationalize its necessity and impact on the overall deployment security posture.
6. Include a troubleshooting section that outlines potential deployment issues and their solutions, encouraging preemptive problem-solving and ongoing system optimization.

Your detailed plan should not only demonstrate a deep understanding of Kubernetes' capabilities but also reflect strategic thinking regarding system scalability, security, and maintenance. The rationale behind each decision should support a balance of theoretical knowledge and practical applicability, showcasing an integrated approach to complex system deployment."
