Revised Prompt:

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to orchestrate a WordPress website with a MySQL database, emphasizing best practices for production-level environments and long-term maintenance. The task involves the following components and considerations:

- **Component Design and Configuration**:
    - Configure two separate Deployments: one named 'wordpress' for the WordPress container using an optimized container image, and another named 'mysql' for the MySQL database. 
    - For each Deployment, include specific resource requests and limits to ensure efficient scalability and reliability.
  
- **Security and Data Handling**:
    - Implement a PersistentVolumeClaim for 'mysql' to ensure data persistence. Discuss the choice of access modes and storage classes tailoring towards a high-availability setup.
    - Employ Kubernetes Secrets to manage sensitive information such as database credentials. Examine how to securely manage and rotate these secrets dynamically.
    - Utilize ConfigMaps to configure both WordPress and MySQL containers, specifying non-sensitive data which affects runtime configuration for both applications.

- **Networking and Inter-Service Communication**:
    - Create Kubernetes Services for both 'wordpress' and 'mysql' to handle internal networking. Deliberate the type of Service best suited for both inter-container communication and external access to the WordPress site.
    
- **Advanced Scenarios and Problem-Solving**:
    - Propose strategies for zero-downtime deployment updates for the WordPress application and the MySQL database. Include considerations for potential rollback mechanisms.
    - Explore the implications of scale on the current design. How would the system architecture withstand a tenfold increase in web traffic?
    - Consider cross-regional deployments for global accessibility and disaster recovery purposes. What challenges might arise, and how can they be mitigated?

Your response should not only address these components in detail but also justify each decision in the context of operational efficiency, security, and scalability. Reflect on how each choice impacts the overall system architecture and ongoing maintenance. The aim of this exercise is to cultivate a deeper understanding of Kubernetes orchestration by applying multidimensional reasoning and anticipating future needs and complications."
