Revised Prompt:

"Devise a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website supported by a MySQL backend, with an emphasis on resilience and optimization for high traffic scenarios. Consider the following complexities and requirements in your design:

- Construct separate Deployments for the WordPress application named 'wordpress' and the MySQL database named 'mysql'. Select appropriate container images that are optimized for performance and security.
  
- For the WordPress Deployment, configure it to handle potential surges in web traffic efficiently. This may include setting resource limits and requests, using appropriate readiness and liveness probes, and specifying an autoscaling policy based on CPU and memory usage.
  
- Embed a MySQL Deployment, focusing on data durability and recovery. Utilize PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence across pod recreations and node failures. Explore different storage class options to find an optimal balance between cost and performance.

- Implement Services for both WordPress and MySQL to maintain stable connections and facilitate service discovery. Analyze and suggest the type of Service (e.g., ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) best suited for each component in a production environment.

- Introduce ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data securely. Challenge yourself to design a system that uses these Kubernetes objects to dynamically alter settings without needing to rebuild or restart containers.

- Consider security best practices, such as network policies to restrict traffic between pods, using TLS for data encryption, and ensuring pods run with the least privilege necessary.

Your task will require multiple steps of reasoning and problem-solving, including decision-making based on trade-offs in system design, resilience, and cost-efficiency. The completion of this task should demonstrate your ability to think critically about Kubernetes deployment strategies and engage with complex systems thinking.

Evaluate and discuss alternative approaches to each component, explaining why specific choices were made over others. Your analysis should delve into how each decision impacts the overall functionality and reliability of the WordPress site under varying conditions."
