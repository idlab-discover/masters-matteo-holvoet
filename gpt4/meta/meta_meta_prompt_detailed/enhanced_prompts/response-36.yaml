Revised Prompt:

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend, tailored for high-availability and optimal performance. Address the following advanced specifications and scenarios:

1. **Container Specifications**: 
    - Name your containers appropriately, with "wordpress" for WordPress and "mysql" for MySQL.
    - Choose suitable container images for both WordPress and MySQL, considering factors like performance, security vulnerabilities, and compatibility with recent updates.

2. **Deployment Configuration**:
    - Construct a Deployment for WordPress and another for MySQL. Include considerations for scaling under high traffic conditions. Specify necessary ports and environment variables for database connectivity in the WordPress deployment.
    - Incorporate advanced health checks and readiness probes to ensure the containers remain performant and reliable. 

3. **Data Persistence and Security**:
    - For MySQL, configure a Deployment using PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence. Discuss the choice of storage class and its impact on performance and data recovery capabilities.
    - Employ Kubernetes Secrets for securing MySQL credentials and ConfigMaps for other configurable parameters. Evaluate the security implications of these methods and suggest any superior alternatives if applicable.

4. **Service Configuration**:
    - Define Kubernetes Services for both WordPress and MySQL, ensuring proper service discovery and network policies that optimize connectivity yet maintain strict access controls.

5. **Scenario-Based Challenges**:
    - Imagine a scenario where the MySQL database experiences intermittent high-load spikes. Propose modifications to the MySQL deployment strategy to handle this effectively.
    - Consider another scenario where the WordPress site must be highly available across multiple geographic regions. Outline a strategy incorporating multi-regional deployments and data replication.

6. **Innovative Integrations**:
    - Encourage exploration of integrating monitoring tools and logging solutions within the Kubernetes configuration to provide insights into application performance and operational issues.
    - Propose how container orchestration adjustments could potentially integrate with existing enterprise systems or cloud services to enhance functionality or resilience.

Your analysis should not only reflect a thorough understanding of Kubernetes configurations but also demonstrate forward-thinking in terms of scalability, security, and system integration challenges. Discuss the reasoning behind your choices and how they contribute to the robustness and efficiency of the deployment setup."
