**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes deployment architecture for a resilient and scalable WordPress website, utilizing a MySQL database for the backend storage. The architecture should reflect best practices in cloud-native development and address real-world deployment challenges. Ensure the elaboration of the manifest includes the following:

- Develop a named configuration for the WordPress container "wordpress" and the MySQL container "mysql", with specific attention to resource optimization and security implications.
- Construct a Kubernetes Deployment for WordPress, selecting suitable container images and configuring ports. Incorporate environment variables that facilitate dynamic database configuration, and demonstrate how these contribute to the system's scalability and security.
- Design a separate Deployment for MySQL with an emphasis on data persistence. Define PersistentVolumeClaims that ensure high availability and data integrity during unforeseen system failures.
- Engineer Kubernetes Services for both WordPress and MySQL. Explain the choice of service type (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) given certain high-availability requirements and anticipated traffic patterns.
- Utilize ConfigMaps and Secrets for managing configuration and sensitive data, respectively. Discuss the security implications of your choices and how using Kubernetes native resources can prevent common configuration errors and security breaches.

In your proposal, also consider:
- The potential impact of container resource limits on the performance of WordPress and MySQL.
- How you would handle database schema updates and WordPress version upgrades in a live environment to minimize downtime and data loss.
- Alternatives to MySQL that could potentially enhance or degrade the performance, security, or cost-effectiveness of the deployment.

Present a reasoned argument for your architectural choices, using scenarios and evidence from existing Kubernetes deployments and industry best practices. The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of Kubernetes orchestration complexities and to stimulate innovative approaches to common deployment scenarios."
