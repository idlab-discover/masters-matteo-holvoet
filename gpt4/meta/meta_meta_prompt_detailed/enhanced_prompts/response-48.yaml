**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend that not only meets standard requirements but challenges typical deployment conventions. Address the following complex requirements:

- Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'.
- Craft a Deployment for WordPress that balances cost-effective container images with performance. Include ports and environment variables necessary for database configuration.
- Develop a MySQL Deployment that incorporates advanced data persistence methodologies through innovative PersistentVolumeClaims usage.
- Establish Services for both WordPress and MySQL to ensure optimal connectivity while considering potential security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks.
- Integrate ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data efficiently. Propose a method to dynamically update these elements without service interruption.

To foster critical analysis and multi-dimensional thinking:
- Rationalize the choice of each container image and configuration, discussing potential trade-offs.
- Analyze how your design considers scalability and fault tolerance.
- Evaluate the security implications of your configuration choices and propose enhancements.
- Define strategies to automate updates and rollbacks without downtime.

Your response should synthesize Kubernetes best practices with insights from cloud architecture and cybersecurity. This exercise aims to push the boundaries of typical Kubernetes deployments, encouraging a rethinking of how these components can be optimally configured for both performance and security within a dynamic environment."
