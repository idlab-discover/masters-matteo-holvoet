Revised Prompt:

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website integrated with a MySQL database, emphasizing resilience and security. The deployment must meet the following advanced criteria:

1. The architecture begins with naming the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'.
2. Develop a WordPress Deployment incorporating:
    - Use of a current, stable WordPress container image.
    - Configuration to expose and secure the required communication ports.
    - Environment variables to connect to the MySQL database should be dynamically linked to ensure resilience in the face of potential changes.
3. Establish a MySQL Deployment that:
    - Implements a PersistentVolumeClaim strategy to ensure data persistence even in scenarios of pod failure.
    - Utilizes a specific, stable MySQL container image suited for high reliability and performance.
4. Create Services for both WordPress and MySQL that not only facilitate basic connectivity but also configure load balancing and session persistence for high availability.
5. Use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration to fine-tune database and WordPress settings while maintaining flexibility for future adjustments without requiring deployment restarts.
6. Deploy Kubernetes Secrets to securely handle all sensitive data including database credentials, ensuring these are encrypted in transit and at rest, integrating best practices for secrets management.

Challenge Scenario:
    - Assume that your deployment will be subject to periodic security audits. Incorporate security best practices in your configurations to safeguard against common vulnerabilities.
    - Design your manifests to be scalable, considering future increases in demand. Illustrate a scaling plan that includes metrics and thresholds to trigger scaling actions automatically.

Expected Outcome:
    - The developed Kubernetes manifest should reflect a deep understanding of Kubernetes deployments, focusing not just on functional requirements but also on security, resilience, and scalability.
    - The reasoning for chosen methodologies and technologies should be articulated, demonstrating an ability to synthesize information from multiple technical domains.
    - The manifest should encourage considerations of various deployment scenarios, fostering a broad perspective on operational integrity and readiness in diverse environments."
