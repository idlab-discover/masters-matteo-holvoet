Revised Prompt:
"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a resilient and secure deployment of a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. Address the following complex scenarios and requirements:

- Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Explain the rationale behind naming containers and how it affects Kubernetes resource management and service discovery.
- Develop a Deployment configuration for WordPress that utilizes an appropriate container image. Include details on how to select an image based on security, stability, and performance factors. Define the configuration of ports and environment variables necessary for connecting to the MySQL database.
- Construct a Deployment for the MySQL database ensuring data persistence. Detail the process of setting up PersistentVolumeClaims. Discuss the considerations for choosing between different types of storage (e.g., local, cloud-based, SSD vs. HDD) and the implications each choice has on performance and cost.
- Create Services for both WordPress and MySQL to facilitate internal and external connectivity. Analyze the trade-offs between using ClusterIP versus NodePort versus LoadBalancer service types in different operational environments.
- Utilize ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration and Secrets for sensitive data handling. Deliberate the security practices in managing secrets within Kubernetes clusters and strategies to mitigate potential security risks.
- Integrate considerations for scalability and fault tolerance within your Kubernetes configurations to handle varying loads and potential node failures. Discuss how horizontal pod autoscaling can be applied to WordPress depending on expected traffic and resource metrics.

Your blueprint should not only address technical specifications but also the thought process and decision-making rationale behind each choice. This exercise aims to deepen your understanding of Kubernetes' design principles and advanced configuration techniques while preparing you to handle real-world deployment scenarios that require both strategic planning and technical agility."
