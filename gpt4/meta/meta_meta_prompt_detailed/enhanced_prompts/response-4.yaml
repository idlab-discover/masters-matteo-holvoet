**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to orchestrate a robust deployment of a WordPress website integrated with a MySQL database backend. To navigate through the complexities of a real-world deployment, address the following advanced requirements:
  - Assign the labels "wordpress" to the WordPress container and "mysql" to the MySQL container.
  - Develop a Deployment schema for WordPress that not only specifies the container images and exposed ports but also leverages environment variables for dynamic database configuration.
  - Construct a MySQL Deployment that incorporates PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence across pod restarts and failures. Deliberate on the choice of access modes and storage capacities that would optimize performance and reliability.
  - Engineer Kubernetes Services for both WordPress and MySQL, planning the type of service that would best support high availability and load balancing.
  - Employ both ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration details and Secrets for managing sensitive data securely. Discuss the implications of storing sensitive information in Kubernetes and propose strategies to safeguard this data.
  - Enhance the scenario by simulating a multi-environment setup (development, staging, production). Include directives in your manifest to accommodate different configurations and security protocols as per the environment specifics.
  - Critically evaluate the choices made with respect to container versions, resource allocations (like CPU and memory limits), and potential scalability challenges. How would these decisions affect the overall system performance and maintenance?

The goal of this task is not only to craft a functional YAML manifest but to also foster a deeper understanding of Kubernetes deployment strategies and their impact on operational efficiency, maintainability, and security. By contemplating these multifaceted aspects, craft a solution that demonstrates advanced knowledge and forward-thinking in application deployment."
