Revised Prompt:
"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to establish a resilient WordPress website paired with a MySQL database for data management. Ensure the architecture reflects advanced deployment strategies and consider the following complexities and optimizations:

1. Configure two separate deployments:
   - **WordPress Deployment**: Name the primary WordPress container 'wordpress'. Utilize a suitable WordPress container image. For enhanced learning, articulate how the chosen image and version affect the deployment's security and efficiency. Specify the necessary ports and environmental variables related to MySQL database connections.
   - **MySQL Deployment**: Name the MySQL container 'mysql'. Use a container image optimized for performance and define the requirements for a PersistentVolumeClaim aimed at ensuring data persistence even in failure scenarios.

2. Define Services for both WordPress and MySQL ensuring seamless connectivity. Explain your choice of service type (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) and demonstrate how changing these types might impact application accessibility and security.

3. Implement ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration details and sensitive information securely. Provide a rationale for items stored as ConfigMaps versus Secrets. Challenge conventional uses by proposing an alternative encryption method for Secrets or an innovative approach to manage configurations dynamically.

4. Introduce complexities by simulating a scenario where the WordPress site must scale based on traffic but remain connected with the standalone MySQL instance. Discuss strategies such as readiness and liveness probes, or replica sets, to handle scalability and reliability.

5. Consider embedding a multi-environment setup (e.g., development, testing, production) within your manifest. Discuss how to manage and isolate these environments effectively using Kubernetes namespaces or context configurations.

Your task is to not only construct the manifest but also provide a detailed explanation for each decision made throughout the design. This will enhance comprehension of Kubernetes' capabilities and limitations and encourage the synthesis of information encompassing IT security, data integrity, and system scalability. Reflect on the adaptive strategies one might employ in various deployment scenarios, promoting a critical evaluation of conventional and emerging techniques in Kubernetes deployments."
