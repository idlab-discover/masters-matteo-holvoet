Revised Prompt:
"Design a Kubernetes manifest for deploying a scalable WordPress website, backed by a MySQL database. Your manifest should resolve the following nuanced scenarios and adhere to best practices for secure and efficient operations:

- Develop two separate deployments within the manifest:
  - The "wordpress" container should be configured with the latest WordPress image. Integrate environmental variables allowing connection to a MySQL database. Propose and justify the choice of WordPress version and configuration settings considering security and performance.
  - The "mysql" container should utilize a MySQL image, configured to use PersistentVolumeClaims to assure data persistence. Evaluate and decide the MySQL version that balances new features with long-term support stability.

- Construct and justify the use of Kubernetes Services for both WordPress and MySQL that ensure clear, secure connectivity between them. Discuss the choice of LoadBalancer versus ClusterIP versus NodePort for WordPress, and which is more appropriate for internal database connectivity.

- Implement and rationalize the use of Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive information management, and ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration. Analyze how these Kubernetes components contribute to both the security posture and the operational management of the deployment.

- Propose a monitoring strategy that ensures high availability and performance of the WordPress website. Include considerations for logging, metrics collection, and relevant alerts configuration.

- Address potential scalability issues:
  - Discuss the implementation of horizontal pod autoscaling for the WordPress deployment and the implications for database performance.
  - Explore the challenges and solutions related to scaling the stateful set of the MySQL database in a production scenario.

Your analysis and designs should not only reflect technical proficiency but also show insight into the practical implications of each decision. Additionally, consider how your manifest design might need to be adjusted for different deployment scenarios (e.g., a small-scale internal application versus a large public e-commerce website). Provide reasoning for your architectural choices and potential trade-offs to balance performance, cost, and maintainability."

This revised prompt necessitates a holistic understanding of Kubernetes, stimulates critical thinking on various deployment scenarios, and encourages the synthesis of knowledge across software development, network management, and cybersecurity domains. Moreover, it highlights the importance of considering broader impacts of technical decisions, fostering a more comprehensive approach to problem-solving.
