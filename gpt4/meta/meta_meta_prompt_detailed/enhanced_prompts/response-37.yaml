Revised Prompt:
"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a resilient WordPress website, coupled with a MySQL database serving as its backend. This deployment should not only adhere to best practices in terms of security and performance but also consider potential scaling and failover strategies. Address the following key elements in your manifest:

1. **Container Configuration**: Assign the names "wordpress" to the WordPress container and "mysql" to the MySQL container. Integrate the latest stable images suitable for a production environment. Reflect on the choice of container images and justify why they are apt for this scenario.

2. **Deployment Specifications**: 
   - Construct a Deployment for WordPress:
     - Incorporate ports and environment variables necessary for connecting to the MySQL database.
     - Explain your strategy for managing WordPress updates without downtime.
   - Formulate a Deployment for MySQL:
     - Ensure data persistence using PersistentVolumeClaims. Discuss the type of storage class you choose and rationalize its suitability based on data access speed and reliability needs.
     - Describe how the database will be restored or switched to a standby in case of a failure.

3. **Service Creation**:
   - Elaborate on constructing Kubernetes Services for both WordPress and MySQL to facilitate internal and external connectivity. Evaluate different types of services like ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and decide which is most appropriate for each component, providing reasons for your choices.

4. **Configuration and Secrets**:
   - Utilize ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration settings. Examine which configurations are ideal to store in ConfigMaps and why.
   - Employ Secrets for safeguarding sensitive configuration details such as database credentials. Discuss any encryption methods or Kubernetes practices that could enhance the security of these secrets.

5. **Challenging Conventional Deployment Strategies**:
   - Propose innovative approaches that could potentially improve performance, security, or cost-effectiveness. For instance, suggest using a more advanced database service like a clustered database environment or integrating a CDN for WordPress content distribution.
   - Encourage considerations of hypothetical scenarios such as an unexpected surge in traffic or a DDoS attack. Plan for such possibilities by detailing preemptive actions and reactive measures within the Kubernetes environment.

Your response should not only be technically sound but also showcase a deep understanding of Kubernetes functionalities and their implications in a real-world production setup. Provide a thorough rationale for every decision, demonstrating how each component and configuration contributes to the overall robustness and efficiency of the deployment. Encourage cross-disciplinary insights where possible, perhaps from software development life cycles, network security, or cloud economics, to provide a holistic view of the deployment strategy."
