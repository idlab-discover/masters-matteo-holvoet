Revised Prompt:
"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a scalable WordPress website interconnected with a robust MySQL database backend. The deployment should prioritize high availability, security, and efficient data handling. The manifest must encapsulate the following nuanced components and considerations:

1. **Container Configuration:**
   - Assign specific and descriptive names to the WordPress and MySQL containers, reflecting their roles within the broader infrastructure.
   - Develop Deployments for each, selecting optimal container images. Justify your choice of images based on factors such as stability, community support, and compatibility with WordPress and MySQL.

2. **Environmental Complexity:**
   - Incorporate environment variables in the WordPress Deployment necessary for database connectivity. Analyze and justify the security and operational implications of your chosen method for environment variable management.
   - Establish a MySQL Deployment, creatively using PersistentVolumeClaims. Discuss the chosen storage class and access modes, considering the data load and potential growth.

3. **Networking and Service Discovery:**
   - Engineer Kubernetes Services for both WordPress and MySQL. Propose a model that supports scalable user access to WordPress while maintaining secure, controlled access to MySQL. Challenge traditional configurations by proposing innovative approaches that might enhance performance or security.

4. **Configuration Management:**
   - Utilize ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration data and justify where and why they should be applied within your deployments.
   - Deliberately employ Secrets for managing sensitive data, including authentication credentials. Evaluate the impact of using Kubernetes Secrets versus other secrets management tools, considering aspects like security, accessibility, and complexity.

5. **Scenario-Based Design Thinking:**
   - Predict and prepare for potential failures or challenges in the application's lifecycle, such as high traffic events or database corruption. Suggest strategies using Kubernetes features like Horizontal Pod Autoscalers, Readiness Probes, or other monitoring tools to mitigate these issues.
   - Reflect on how changes in one component of the system (e.g., an update to the MySQL version) could impact other components. Propose a resilience testing plan to ensure system robustness.

Final deliverable should not only detail the technical implementation but also include a comprehensive rationale for each decision made, considering alternative approaches and the specific needs of a high-traffic, secure WordPress website deployment. This exercise aims to deepen your understanding of Kubernetes' capabilities and encourage a critical evaluation of deployment choices within a cloud-native ecosystem."
