Revised Prompt:
"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest tailored for a deployment scenario involving a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. Address the following complex problem-solving challenges:

- Architect the solution to name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'.
- Develop a Deployment for WordPress using suitable container images; specify the necessary ports and environment variables for optimal database interactions. Introduce an hypothetical scenario where the WordPress site experiences high traffic volumes, and outline how you would configure the WordPress container to handle this increased load efficiently.
- Construct a MySQL Deployment that incorporates PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence. Expand on this by detailing a plan for scaling the database in response to varying loads, possibly integrating StatefulSets for maintaining stateful information across pod recreations.
- Formulate Services for both WordPress and MySQL to facilitate proper network connectivity. Discuss potential networking challenges you might encounter in a multi-node Kubernetes cluster and propose solutions to address these.
- Utilize ConfigMaps for standard configuration while implementing Secrets to manage sensitive data such as database credentials. Challenge conventional configurations by explaining how you could enhance the security of these elements, possibly by integrating Kubernetes-native security enhancements or third-party tools.
- Evaluate the overall configuration's resilience to failures and propose a contingency plan that ensures high availability and minimal downtime.

Your response should not only demonstrate a deep understanding of Kubernetes' capabilities but also show foresight in handling possible real-world operational challenges. By analyzing this scenario, discuss how diverse technological integration can result in robust, scalable, and secure deployments."
