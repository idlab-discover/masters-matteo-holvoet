**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a Kubernetes configuration to set up a WordPress website with a MySQL backend, ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization. The YAML manifest should adhere to the following advanced guidelines:

- Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'.
- Construct two separate Deployments:
  1. A WordPress Deployment using a suitable container image. Specify resource requests and limits to optimize performance and cost. Incorporate environment variables and other necessary configurations to connect to the MySQL database.
  2. A MySQL Deployment, utilizing a reliable version of the MySQL image. Include PersistentVolumeClaims to manage data persistence, considering factors like storage capacity and access modes tailored to expected traffic and data growth.
- Create Kubernetes Services for both WordPress and MySQL to facilitate stable intra-cluster connectivity. Discuss the choice of Service type and the implications on network performance and security.
- Implement ConfigMaps to externalize configuration parameters of WordPress and Secrets to securely handle sensitive data such as database credentials. Explain the strategic advantage of separating these configurations and the security implications involved.
- Given potential scalability needs, detail a strategy for scaling the WordPress application in response to varying load. Include considerations for both horizontal and vertical scaling and the triggers that might initiate scaling actions.
- Consider a scenario where the MySQL database needs to be accessed by another application for data analysis purposes. Propose a secure method to allow this access without compromising the security of the WordPress site's data.

Your submission should not only show proficiency in Kubernetes configuration but also demonstrate comprehensive reasoning behind each choice, reflecting on best practices and potential trade-offs in complex scenarios. Discuss how these configurations might differ if deployed in a multi-cloud environment versus a single cloud service provider." 

This revision encourages a deeper understanding of Kubernetes deployment strategies, emphasizing considerations for security, scalability, efficiency, and cross-application connectivity. The prompt invites an advanced exploration of operational complexities and strategic decision-making in real-world scenarios.
