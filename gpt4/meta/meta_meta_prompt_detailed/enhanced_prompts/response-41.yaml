**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to facilitate the deployment of a WordPress website interfaced with a MySQL database backend. The deployment should optimize resource utilization and ensure high availability and scalability. Address the following specifications and challenges:

  - Name the respective containers as 'wordpress' for the WordPress deployment and 'mysql' for MySQL.
  - Construct a detailed WordPress Deployment configuration that includes:
    - Selection of a suitable container image and justification for this choice.
    - Configuration of ports and essential environment variables related to the database connectivity.
    - Discussion of WordPress scaling strategies within a Kubernetes environment and propose a method for implementing these strategies.
  - Develop a MySQL Deployment inclusive of:
    - PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence. Analyze the trade-offs between different types of storage classes and justify your chosen type.
    - Strategies for ensuring the MySQL deployment is secure and robust against potential database corruptions or failures.
  - Implement Services for both WordPress and MySQL to manage internal cluster connectivity. Evaluate alternative networking options within Kubernetes and select the most appropriate for this scenario.
  - Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to handle configuration data and sensitive information securely:
    - Outline a plan for managing secrets lifecycle including creation, deployment and rotation. 
    - Discuss potential security vulnerabilities in managing sensitive data and how your implementation plan mitigates these risks.

Your manifest should not only meet the outlined operational criteria but also engage with considerations such as cost-efficiency, maintainability, and potential bottlenecks. Provide a rationale for each aspect of your configuration, identifying possible alternatives and the reasons for your selections.

This task challenges you to synthesize knowledge from Kubernetes deployment strategies, data management, network engineering, and cybersecurity to create a well-rounded and insightful solution. Consider not only the functionality of the system but also the wider architectural implications of your choices."

**Key Considerations for Review:**
- Your solutions should stimulate innovative problem-solving by incorporating unconventional approaches when suitable.
- Foster comprehensive understanding through multi-layered reasoning and in-depth justification of choices.
- Encourage a broad exploration and synthesis of technological, operational, and strategic considerations across the Kubernetes ecosystem and beyond.
