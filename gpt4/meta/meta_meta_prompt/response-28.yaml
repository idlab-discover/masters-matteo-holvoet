Given the complexity and multi-faceted nature of the prompt, let's break down each part of the request while constructing the corresponding Kubernetes YAML manifests. The manifest will include deployments for WordPress and MySQL, service definitions, configurations for high availability, multi-zone replication, observability with Prometheus, and security best practices.

### Part 1: Deployment Manifests for WordPress & MySQL with High Availability Constraints

Here we configure WordPress and MySQL with a focus on high availability. Weâ€™ll set up multiple replicas and resource limits to handle varying loads effectively.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
  labels:
    app: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "200m"
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: "500m"
          limits:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: "1"
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
```

### Part 2: Setting up Multi-Zone Clusters

Assign workloads to multiple zones to enhance availability. This setup requires configuring affinity policies at the Kubernetes scheduler level.

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      affinity:
        podAntiAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - weight: 100
            podAffinityTerm:
              labelSelector:
                matchExpressions:
                - key: "app"
                  operator: In
                  values:
                  - wordpress
                  - mysql
              topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
      nodeSelector:
        topology.kubernetes.io/zone: <zone-name>
```

### Part 3: Prometheus Monitoring

We will include annotations to scrape metrics for Prometheus. Key metrics for WordPress could include HTTP traffic and error rates, and for MySQL, it would be query execution times, connection counts, and error rates.

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "80"
```

### Part 4: Kubernetes Security Best Practices

We should rotate credentials, use NetworkPolicies to restrict traffic, and store sensitive information in Kubernetes Secrets.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: <base64-encoded-password>
---
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: database-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: wordpress
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```

### Part 5: Future Scalability Considerations

Future scalability may involve integrating Redis for caching and Elasticsearch for enhanced search capabilities. These implementations would need additional deployments and service definitions similar to what we have defined for WordPress and MySQL.

### Conclusion

This configuration offers a robust setup with considerations for availability, security, monitoring, and future scalability. It reflects a practical approach to deploying complex applications on Kubernetes.
