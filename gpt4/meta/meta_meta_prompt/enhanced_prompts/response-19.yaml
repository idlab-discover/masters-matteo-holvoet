Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with scalability and fault tolerance in mind, utilizing a MySQL database as the backend. The deployment should include the following specifics: the WordPress container should be named 'wordpress', and the MySQL container should be named 'mysql'. Further, detail the strategies you would use to manage database state and maintain continuous availability in a scenario where the cluster experiences high traffic or hardware failure. Propose a monitoring plan to oversee the performance of both the WordPress and MySQL containers, ensuring optimal user experience and data integrity. Additionally, discuss potential security vulnerabilities and describe how you would secure the deployment against common security threats." 

This enhanced prompt encourages participants to engage in deeper thinking about system architecture and lifecycle management, demands planning for real-world scenarios, emphasizes security considerations, and promotes a holistic approach to system design and operational resilience.
