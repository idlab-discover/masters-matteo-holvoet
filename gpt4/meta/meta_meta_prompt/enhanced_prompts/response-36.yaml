Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a scalable deployment of a WordPress website connecting to a MySQL database, with special emphasis on high availability and security. Begin by incorporating the primary services: naming the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Consider the following multi-layered objectives: First, integrate robust security practices like secret management to secure database credentials. Second, outline strategies for load balancing and auto-scaling to handle variable traffic scenarios, ensuring the system remains highly available even during peak loads. Third, critically evaluate and choose appropriate persistent storage options for MySQL to ensure data integrity during failover situations. Finally, discuss the potential use of network policies to isolate communication between the containers to prevent unauthorized access. Provide justification and reasoning for each design decision, reflecting on how these choices impact system resilience and performance."
