Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website integrated with a MySQL backend, ensuring high availability and scalability. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Address the following considerations:

1. Discuss the choice of WordPress and MySQL images, considering factors like updates, security vulnerabilities, and support for existing plugins.
2. Explain how you would configure persistent storage for MySQL and WordPress to ensure data durability across pod restarts and node failures.
3. Outline a strategy for automating database backups and a plan for the quick recovery of WordPress content in case of data loss.
4. Evaluate the potential security risks associated with the deployment and propose measures, including network policies and security contexts, to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
5. Propose a scaling strategy for both WordPress and MySQL containers that optimally handles varying traffic loads. Include criteria for when scaling should trigger and the method of load balancing.
6. Identify potential issues that might arise from this configuration and suggest proactive solutions to prevent or resolve these concerns.

Incorporate reasoning from at least two external domains (e.g., network security, cloud economics) to support your choices. This prompt expects you to synthesize information from diverse sources to create a comprehensive Kubernetes deployment strategy."
