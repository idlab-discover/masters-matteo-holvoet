Revised Prompt: "Devise a resilient Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website, incorporating a MySQL database for backend operations. The deployment should ensure high availability and scalability for both the WordPress and MySQL containers, named 'wordpress' and 'mysql', respectively. Additionally, formulate a strategy to secure the MySQL database against potential SQL injection attacks and suggest a method to automatically scale the resources based on traffic predictions. Evaluate the benefits and potential challenges of integrating a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with this setup, reflecting on how it could impact the performance and security of the website. Provide rationales for each design choice, considering different traffic scenarios and security threats."
