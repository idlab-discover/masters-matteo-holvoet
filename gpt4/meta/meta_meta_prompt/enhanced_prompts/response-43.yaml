Revised Prompt: "Devise a detailed plan for a Kubernetes YAML configuration that will robustly deploy a WordPress website using a MySQL database backend. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Additionally, address the following challenges:

1. **Scale and Load Balancing:** Propose a strategy to ensure the WordPress site can handle high traffic loads efficiently without performance degradation. Detail the use of Kubernetes resources like Horizontal Pod Autoscalers and Load Balancers.

2. **Data Persistence:** Describe a method to ensure data persistence for the MySQL database in the event of a pod failure. Include an explanation of Persistent Volumes and StatefulSets, and discuss their implications in terms of data recovery and statefulness.

3. **Security and Secret Management:** Illustrate how you would secure sensitive information, such as database credentials, using Kubernetes secrets. Explain the security benefits and potential vulnerabilities that this method might entail.

4. **Network Policies:** Develop network policies that strictly control the traffic flow between the WordPress and MySQL containers to safeguard against potential internal threats.

5. **Resource Limits and Requests:** Establish guidelines for setting appropriate CPU and memory requests and limits for both the WordPress and MySQL containers to ensure efficient resource utilization and prevent resource starvation.

By addressing these advanced setup requirements, the objective is to enhance your understanding of Kubernetes' capabilities to handle complex scenarios and encourage thoughtful integration of best practices in deployment architecture."
