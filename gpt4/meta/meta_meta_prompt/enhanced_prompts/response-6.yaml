Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a scalable WordPress website with MySQL as its database backend, ensuring high availability and security. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Consider the following complexities:

1. Explain how you would structure your Kubernetes resources (Pods, Services, Ingress, Volumes, etc.) to optimize for both performance and cost-efficiency.
2. Incorporate strategies for securing sensitive data, such as MySQL credentials, utilizing Kubernetes secrets or similar mechanisms. Justify your choice of method.
3. Describe the process of handling persistent data in a scenario where the MySQL container might fail and restart. Ensure data persistence and minimal downtime.
4. Address potential traffic spikes: Outline a configuration that allows the WordPress site to scale dynamically in response to increased web traffic.
5. Reflect on possible impacts of implementing network policies within Kubernetes to control the traffic flow between the WordPress and MySQL containers.

The goal is to draft a Kubernetes YAML configuration that not only meets the deployment needs but also incorporates advanced resource management, security best practices, and fault tolerance. Analyze and justify each part of your configuration, detailing the interdependencies and the reasons behind each choice."
