Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website using a MySQL database as the backend while considering the following challenges: First, ensure that the WordPress container named 'wordpress' and the MySQL container named 'mysql' can sustain sudden spikes in traffic, possibly by integrating auto-scaling functionalities. Secondly, address potential security vulnerabilities inherent in such deployments by suggesting and implementing security best practices within your configuration. Lastly, analyze how changes to the underlying database schema might impact the WordPress container and propose a strategy for managing such changes without downtime. Provide a justification for each decision made in your design, citing possible alternatives and the reasons for your choices."
