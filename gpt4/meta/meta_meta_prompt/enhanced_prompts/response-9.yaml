Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a high-availability WordPress website using a MySQL database with replication as the backend. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL master and slave containers 'mysql-master' and 'mysql-slave' respectively. Ensure the WordPress application is scalable and resilient to database downtime. Additionally, discuss the considerations and modifications necessary to optimize for both performance under heavy load and security against common web vulnerabilities. Outline potential impacts on the deployment if one of the MySQL instances fails and suggest strategies for automated recovery and minimal downtime. Provide a brief rationale for each design choice."

This prompt includes the following enhancements:
- It asks for design considerations beyond a simple setup (replication, high availability).
- It requires reasoning about scalability, resilience, performance optimization, and security - promoting a multi-layered analytical approach.
- It introduces a scenario that tests the resilience of the system and demands planning for automated recovery - a complex problem-solving element.
- It encourages explanations for technical choices, fostering deeper understanding and critical analysis.
