Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a scalable WordPress website deployment using a MySQL database as its backend. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Consider the following constraints and scenarios: 
1. Optimize for high traffic volumes, ensuring minimal downtime. How can Kubernetes' features like auto-scaling and load balancing can be leveraged in your design?
2. Address potential security vulnerabilities in container communication. What are the implications of using Network Policies in Kubernetes, and how would you implement them in this context?
3. Evaluate and justify the choice of persistent storage for MySQL to ensure data integrity during unexpected failures.
4. Propose a monitoring strategy that would help maintain the health of the deployment. What metrics would be most critical to monitor, and which tools would you integrate for effective monitoring?
This task challenges you to integrate knowledge of Kubernetes architecture with security, scalability, and data management considerations, promoting a holistic approach to system design and operational efficiency. Provide a detailed explanation of your choices and how they interconnect to form a cohesive deployment strategy."
