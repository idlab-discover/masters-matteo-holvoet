Revised Prompt: "Design and document a comprehensive deployment strategy for a scalable WordPress website, supported by a MySQL database, using Kubernetes. The WordPress container should be named 'wordpress', and the MySQL container 'mysql'. In your solution, address the following points:
1. Outline a multi-tier deployment strategy where each component (WordPress and MySQL) runs in separate pods and detail the intercommunication paths.
2. Evaluate different storage options for the MySQL database within Kubernetes, considering persistent storage needs and disaster recovery scenarios.
3. Propose a scalable networking solution that could effectively manage an increasing amount of web traffic and database queries.
4. Discuss and design security measures for both the 'wordpress' and 'mysql' containers, focusing on network policies, container security best practices, and data encryption.
5. Integrate monitoring and logging mechanisms that would help in proactive detection of issues and efficient troubleshooting.

Your strategy should not only demonstrate your Kubernetes expertise but also reflect a deep understanding of container orchestration challenges, potential scalability, security concerns, and network efficiency in a cloud-native environment."
