Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a high-availability WordPress website using a MySQL database with redundancy as the backend. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Ensure that the solution includes considerations for load balancing, persistent data storage options, and a strategy to handle possible database failures. Explain the choices made in your design particularly focusing on the configuration of network resources, data consistency, and potential impacts of pod failures on the deployed application. Additionally, outline a plan on scaling the application based on varying traffic and discuss the security implications of your configuration choices."
