Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a resilient deployment of a WordPress website, utilizing a MySQL database as its backend under a high-availability configuration. Consider scenarios where both primary and secondary MySQL database instances named 'mysql-primary' and 'mysql-secondary', respectively, function in a failover capacity. Incorporate considerations for scalability, such as pod autoscaling for the WordPress container 'wordpress', based on varying web traffic loads. Further, elaborate on how Kubernetes deployments might interact differently when facing inconsistent network latencies and the potential security concerns arising from this setup. Finally, synthesize your approach by discussing potential trade-offs and performance impacts resulting from these configurations."
