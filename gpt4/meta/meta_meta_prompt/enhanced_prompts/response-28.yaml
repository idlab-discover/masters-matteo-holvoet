**Revised Prompt:**
"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Expand this scenario by addressing the following considerations: 

1. Optimize the deployment strategy for high availability and efficient resource utilization. Justify your choices for replica counts, resource limits, and auto-scaling thresholds.
2. Implement a multi-zone setup for redundancy. Discuss the potential challenges and benefits of distributing the WordPress and MySQL containers across different Kubernetes zones.
3. Integrate a monitoring solution using Prometheus. Outline the key metrics that should be monitored to ensure optimal performance and reliability of both the WordPress site and the database.
4. Propose security best practices for both the containers and the data transmission processes. Include details on network policies, secret management, and any other security mechanisms you find pertinent.
5. Reflect on how you might accommodate future scalability and potential integration with additional services like caching or search capabilities.

Your response should not only include the technical specifications but also a rationale for each decision to foster a holistic understanding of deploying and managing the proposed Kubernetes environment."
