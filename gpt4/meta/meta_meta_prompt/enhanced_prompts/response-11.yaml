Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with scalability in mind, utilizing a MySQL database for backend storage. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Additionally, ensure that the deployment allows for both high availability and secure data handling. Describe how you would configure the services to:

1. Automatically manage traffic increases by scaling pods horizontally.
2. Maintain data integrity and security between WordPress and MySQL, emphasizing configurations that protect against common vulnerabilities.
3. Implement persistent storage solutions to prevent data loss during pod failures.
4. Consider environmental constraints that may affect performance, such as limited network bandwidth or high-latency conditions.

Further, analyze and discuss potential challenges that might arise with your configuration. Explore alternative strategies and compare their benefits and drawbacks in terms of resource utilization, cost, and simplicity of setup."
