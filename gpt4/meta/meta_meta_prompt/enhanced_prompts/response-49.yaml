Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a resilient and scalable WordPress website integrated with a MySQL database backend. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Additionally, include the following complexities: 

1. Configure persistent storage for the MySQL database to ensure data durability across pod restarts.
2. Implement a pod affinity rule to optimize the placement of the WordPress and MySQL pods on different nodes to enhance fault tolerance.
3. Introduce a horizontal pod autoscaler for the WordPress deployment to manage load dynamically based on traffic.
4. Create network policies to secure the communication between the WordPress and MySQL containers, ensuring that only these two containers can communicate with each other.
5. Include resource limits and requests to ensure efficient utilization of cluster resources.

Analyze the potential challenges and benefits each of these additions brings to the deployment scenario. Also, evaluate how such a design can support long-term scalability and maintenance of the website."
