Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML configuration that establishes a scalable WordPress site, leveraging a MySQL database for data storage. Ensure that the WordPress container is named 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. To foster a thorough evaluation of the deployment architecture, consider the following multi-layered tasks:

1. **Security and Compliance**: Integrate considerations for securing sensitive data within the MySQL database and detail how you would implement Kubernetes secrets for managing database credentials.

2. **Scalability and High Availability**: Elaborate on how you would configure horizontal pod autoscaling for the WordPress container to handle varying loads. Discuss the implications of using a single MySQL instance versus a clustered setup in terms of reliability and performance.

3. **Environmental Differences**: Propose strategies for different deployment scenarios such as development, testing, and production with appropriate modifications in resource allocations and debugging capabilities.

4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Describe a monitoring strategy that allows for proactive maintenance practices. Include details on logging, performance metrics, and alert systems tailored to the specific needs of a WordPress site.

5. **Innovation Challenge**: Lastly, imagine a scenario where standard deployment methodologies are restricted due to hypothetical regulatory or technological constraints (e.g., limited access to certain cloud resources, stringent data locality requirements). Propose an innovative deployment architecture that addresses these constraints while maintaining operational efficiency and security.

Your detailed YAML configuration should reflect these considerations, promoting a comprehensive and strategic approach to deploying WordPress with Kubernetes. Additionally, illustrate how each proposed solution impacts the overall system behavior and performance, encouraging a synthesis of knowledge across cybersecurity, software engineering, and systems architecture."
