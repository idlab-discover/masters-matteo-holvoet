Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a secure and scalable WordPress website using a MySQL database as the backend. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Consider the following factors in your design: 

1. How would you ensure high availability and fault tolerance for both the WordPress and MySQL containers?
2. Propose a strategy for securing sensitive data, including password management and data encryption, in connection with the MySQL database.
3. Explore and justify the use of specific Kubernetes resources such as ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Persistent Volumes in your deployment.
4. Discuss potential challenges and solutions in scaling this deployment to handle an increase from 1,000 to 100,000 concurrent users.
5. Evaluate the implications of implementing a microservices architecture versus a traditional monolithic approach in this context."

This revision aims to challenge the responder to think critically about infrastructure robustness, data security, resource management, scalability, and the architectural choices that impact performance and maintainability.
