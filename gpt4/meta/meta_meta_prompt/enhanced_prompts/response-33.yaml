Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website integrated with a MySQL database as the backend. Assign the names 'wordpress' and 'mysql' for the WordPress and MySQL containers respectively. In your design, consider and elaborate on the following multidimensional challenges:
   
   1. **Scalability**: Outline how your Kubernetes setup would handle potential high traffic scenarios. Discuss horizontal vs. vertical scaling methodologies for both 'wordpress' and 'mysql' containers.
   
   2. **Security**: Propose a strategy to secure sensitive data within the MySQL container from potential breaches or insider threats. Include considerations regarding network policies, secrets management, and data encryption both at rest and in transit.
   
   3. **Resource Efficiency**: Create resource requests and limits for your containers to ensure efficient use of cluster resources. Explain the reasoning behind your choices, and discuss potential impacts on performance and reliability.
   
   4. **Maintenance and Monitoring**: Describe a plan for monitoring the health and performance of the WordPress site and MySQL database. Include how you would implement logging, monitoring, and potentially autoscaling based on certain metrics.
   
   5. **Disaster Recovery**: Construct a scenario where the current active nodes hosting the 'mysql' container fail. Detail the steps involved in the recovery process, including data restoration and minimizing downtime.
   
Explain your conceptual rationale and operational steps comprehensively to demonstrate how Kubernetes' features and tools can effectively manage and optimize a WordPress-MySQL deployment under varying conditions and constraints."
