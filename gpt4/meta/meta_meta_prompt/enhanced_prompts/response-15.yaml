Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a scalable WordPress website alongside a persistent MySQL database as the backend. Consider the following scenarios: 1) Optimize for high-traffic volumes by implementing auto-scaling capabilities for the WordPress container named 'wordpress'. 2) Ensure data consistency and security by configuring a MySQL container named 'mysql' with replicated databases and encrypted connections. How would you architect these deployments to maximize uptime and minimize latency? What Kubernetes resources and properties would you employ to achieve these goals? Additionally, explore the potential trade-offs or challenges you might encounter with this configuration in a cloud-native environment."
