Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend, ensuring that the deployment is scalable and secure. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Additionally, consider the following scenarios:
   - How would you adjust your deployment strategy if the WordPress site unexpectedly receives a significant surge in traffic?
   - Analyze and propose solutions for potential security vulnerabilities in communication between the 'wordpress' and 'mysql' containers.
   - Develop a plan for data persistence that addresses potential issues of data loss in the MySQL database.
Further, discuss the implications of integrating a CDN and an SSL/TLS implementation for improving content delivery and security in your deployment strategy. This will require synthesizing information from network security, database management, and cloud infrastructure optimization domains."
