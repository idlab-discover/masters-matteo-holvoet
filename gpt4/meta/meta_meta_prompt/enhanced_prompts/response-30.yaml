**Revised Prompt:**
"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website accompanied by a MySQL database for storage. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Additionally:

1. Analyze and justify the selection of specific Kubernetes resources (e.g., Pods, Deployments, Services) for maximizing the scalability and reliability of both the WordPress and MySQL deployments.
2. Develop a strategy for securing the communication between the WordPress and MySQL containers. Propose and rationalize the implementation of security measures, such as network policies and secret management.
3. Enumerate potential high-traffic scenarios and describe how your Kubernetes configuration would handle sudden, unexpected surges in web traffic.
4. Consider the environmental impact of your deployment choices. Discuss alternative configurations that might reduce carbon emissions without compromising performance.
5. Reflect on the future-proofing of the deployment: How would your configuration accommodate the likely influx of newer versions of WordPress and MySQL, along with the possible integration of additional technologies or services?"
