Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website integrated with a MySQL database, addressing multi-tier architecture requirements. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Additionally, include the following challenges to broaden your understanding and analytical skills:

1. Configure persistent storage for both the MySQL database and the WordPress application to ensure data persistence across pod restarts. Provide reasoning for your choice of Kubernetes storage solutions.
2. Incorporate resource limits and requests for each container to optimize resource utilization and cost-effectiveness. Justify your configurations based on potential load scenarios.
3. Implement a strategy for scaling the application based on anticipated traffic patterns. Discuss the pros and cons of horizontal vs. vertical scaling in this scenario.
4. Ensure high availability and load balancing for both WordPress and MySQL. Propose a suitable method and explain how it will handle failover and service disruptions.
5. Address potential security vulnerabilities by specifying security contexts and other best practices for container security. Highlight how these measures mitigate common security threats.

This revised prompt encourages a detailed exploration of system design, operational efficiency, and security implications, pushing for a comprehensive solution that goes beyond a basic deployment."
