Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML configuration to establish a resilient, scalable deployment for a WordPress website, utilizing a MySQL database for data persistence. In your configuration, name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Consider the following factors in your design:

1. **Scalability**: Incorporate strategies for both vertical and horizontal scaling of the WordPress application and MySQL database, explaining the benefits and potential trade-offs of each approach.

2. **Resilience**: Detail how you would ensure high availability and disaster recovery of both the WordPress and MySQL containers. Include a plan for data backup and recovery processes.

3. **Security**: Describe the security measures you would recommend to safeguard both the application and the database, considering aspects such as network policies, data encryption, and access controls.

4. **Integration**: Explain how this setup would integrate with existing enterprise systems, including network infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring solutions.

5. **Environmental Impact**: Discuss potential environmental impacts of your deployment strategy and suggest ways to mitigate negative effects, such as optimizing resource usage to reduce energy consumption.

Your response should not only address these elements thoroughly but also consider potential future expansions and technology shifts. How can this deployment be future-proofed against rapid technological advancements and changes in web traffic patterns?"
