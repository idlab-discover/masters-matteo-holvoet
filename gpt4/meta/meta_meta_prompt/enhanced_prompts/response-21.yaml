Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website that uses a MySQL database for backend storage. Label the WordPress container as 'wordpress' and the MySQL container as 'mysql'. Consider the following advanced scenarios and constraints to optimize the deployment for security, scalability, and maintainability:

1. Security: Implement the best practices for securing database credentials and restrict unauthorized access using Kubernetes secrets and network policies.
2. Scalability: Explain how you would configure your setup to handle sudden increases in web traffic. Include strategies for horizontally scaling the WordPress instances and ensuring the database's performance under load, utilizing Kubernetes autoscaling features and resource limits.
3. Maintenance: Detail a strategy for zero-downtime deployment updates to both WordPress and MySQL components. Include steps for rolling updates and handling data persistence across updates.
4. Cost-effectiveness: Evaluate different storage options and explain the trade-offs involved in choosing one type over another, focusing on cost implications in a cloud environment.

Discuss the implications of each strategy on the overall system architecture and justify your choices with respect to the operational challenges. This exercise aims to encourage a comprehensive understanding of multifaceted deployment scenarios, focusing on achieving an optimal balance between functionality and operational efficiency. Additionally, illustrate how each component of the manifest contributes to the resilience and efficiency of the deployment."
