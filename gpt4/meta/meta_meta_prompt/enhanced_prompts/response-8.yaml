**Revised Prompt:** "Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML configuration that deploys a scalable WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. In your configuration, name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. To enhance the scenario's complexity, incorporate the following specifications:

1. **Security Optimization:** Propose measures to secure data transactions between WordPress and MySQL. Include considerations for secure secrets management and network policies.
2. **Resource Constraints:** Define Kubernetes resources limits and requests for both containers to optimize performance and manage resource consumption efficiently.
3. **Scalability Challenge:** Outline a strategy that allows the WordPress service to scale dynamically in response to varying traffic loads. Include a high availability setup for the database, ensuring minimal downtime.
4. **Maintenance and Upgrade Path:** Develop a process within the configuration for smooth upgrades of WordPress and MySQL without service interruption. How would you manage persistent volume claims during these upgrades?
5. **Evaluation Metrics:** Suggest practical metrics and methods for monitoring the performance and health of the deployment. Include the rationale behind selecting each metric.

Your response should not only incorporate technical Kubernetes specifications but also discuss the reasoning behind each decision, considering best practices and potential trade-offs involved. How do these configurations impact the overall system resilience, efficiency, and security?"
