**Revised Prompt**: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a scalable WordPress website integrated with a MySQL database, ensuring both high availability and security. The containers should be named 'wordpress' and 'mysql', respectively. Critically evaluate and choose between using StatefulSets and Deployments for the MySQL database, considering factors such as data persistence, update strategies, and failure recovery mechanisms. Additionally, explore and justify the use of different Kubernetes networking options for inter-container communications and external access. Prepare to discuss potential security vulnerabilities and present mitigation strategies that align with best practices in Kubernetes deployments."
