**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website interfaced with a MySQL database. In this task, name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Explore the following challenges:

1. **Scalability**: Propose a configuration that supports scaling up the WordPress containers dynamically based on traffic load. Explain your reasoning for choosing specific replication and autoscaling parameters.
   
2. **Security**: Integrate security practices into the deployment. Discuss how you would secure the communication between the WordPress and MySQL containers. Include considerations for network policies and secret management to protect sensitive data.
   
3. **Data Persistence**: Design a strategy for persistent data storage ensuring database recovery and rollback capabilities in case of failures. Evaluate different storage options and justify your choice based on performance and reliability criteria.

4. **Cost Optimization**: Analyze the cost implications of your configuration choices. Discuss potential trade-offs between performance, scalability, and cost, considering different cloud service models and resource types.

Further, simulate a scenario where the initial deployment faces performance bottlenecks. Describe your troubleshooting process, the metrics you would monitor, and how you would iteratively refine the system architecture.

Your response should not only reflect a technical blueprint but also a strategic plan that accommodates growth, efficiency, and resilience. This exercise will help you grasp the complexities of deploying web applications in a cloud-native environment and encourage a holistic approach to system design and management."
