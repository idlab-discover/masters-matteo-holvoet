**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website integrated with a MySQL database, ensuring high availability and resilience. Consider the following criteria for the deployment:

1. **Scalability and Load Management:** Outline strategies for scaling the WordPress container "wordpress" and the MySQL container "mysql" horizontally and vertically in response to fluctuating traffic. Discuss the implications of each strategy.

2. **Security Considerations:** Embed security practices within the deployment configuration. Propose methods for securing sensitive database credentials and safeguarding the WordPress installation against common vulnerabilities.

3. **Resource Optimization:** Detail how resources such as CPU and memory should be allocated and adjusted for each container, considering cost-effectiveness and performance optimization. Provide reasoning for your choices.

4. **Challenging Convention:** Introduce an innovative approach to typical WordPress deployments, such as integrating a CDN or using a non-traditional database for caching queries from WordPress.

5. **Failure Scenarios and Recovery:** Analyze potential failure points in the deployment architecture and present detailed, step-by-step recovery strategies. Include backup solutions and disaster recovery plans.

The output should not only provide the Kubernetes manifest but also articulate the rationale behind each decision in the context of system performance, security, cost-efficiency, and maintainability. This approach should foster an integrated view of system architecture and deployment strategy."
