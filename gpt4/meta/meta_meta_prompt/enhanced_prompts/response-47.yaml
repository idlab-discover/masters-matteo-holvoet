Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend, ensuring high availability and scalability. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Deliberate on the following aspects: 

1. How would you configure persistent volumes and volume claims to manage database storage and WordPress state, considering potential data growth?
2. Explore strategies for securing the communication between the WordPress and MySQL containers. What Kubernetes resources and configurations would you utilize to enhance security?
3. Devise an approach for auto-scaling both the WordPress and MySQL containers based on traffic needs. What metrics would you consider for scaling, and why?
4. Discuss the implications of deploying this architecture in a multi-regional Kubernetes cluster. How would this affect latency, data integrity, and overall user experience?
5. Propose a plan for regular updates and maintenance without downtime. What best practices would you follow to ensure continuous availability during updates?

The response should not only outline technical implementations but also reflect on the broader impact, such as performance, security, and user satisfaction, thus proposing a well-rounded solution."
