Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to orchestrate a WordPress website with a MySQL database. Start by naming the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Additionally, consider the following scenarios in your design process:

1. Scalability and resilience: Construct your manifest with considerations for scaling both the WordPress front-end and MySQL back-end under varying loads. Explain how your configuration will handle fluctuations in website traffic, particularly during peak periods.

2. Security measures: Incorporate strategies to secure the data exchanged between the WordPress and MySQL containers. Outline how you will implement network policies and other Kubernetes features to secure sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

3. Resource management: Plan and justify the allocation of resources (e.g., CPU, memory limits, and requests) to each container. Discuss the implications of your choices and how they will affect the performance and stability of the deployment.

4. Multi-environment deployment: Discuss how you would modify your manifest to cater to different deployment environments (development, testing, and production). Include considerations for environment-specific configurations such as volume management for data persistence, logging, and monitoring setups.

5. Error handling and recovery: Describe how your configuration addresses potential failures or crashes in both the WordPress and MySQL containers. Include strategies for data backup and recovery, and elaborate on the mechanisms for container health checks and auto-recovery.

Provide a rationale for each part of your YAML configuration, supporting your decisions with Kubernetes best practices and principles."
