Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a scalable WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. In your design, name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Address the following challenges to ensure robust and efficient deployment: 
1. Incorporate strategies for high availability and load balancing for both WordPress and MySQL components. Explain your choices.
2. Propose a solution for secure communication between the WordPress and MySQL containers. Detail the methods used for securing sensitive data, considering both at-rest and in-transit scenarios.
3. Analyze the potential impact of resource limits (CPU and memory) on the containers' performance and suggest an initial configuration for these parameters.
4. Discuss how you would implement a backup strategy for the MySQL database that ensures data integrity and minimal downtime, and justify your approach.
This task requires integration of Kubernetes orchestration principles, security best practices, and performance optimization knowledge. Conclude by evaluating how your deployment strategy could be adapted for different scenarios, such as a sudden increase in web traffic or a deployment in a multi-cloud environment."
