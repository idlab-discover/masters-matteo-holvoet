Revised Prompt: "Devise a Kubernetes YAML configuration for a scalable WordPress site complemented by a MySQL database backend. Designate the WordPress container as 'wordpress' and the MySQL container as 'mysql'. Integrate the following additional complexities to heighten the problem-solving scope:

1. Enable multi-environment support (development, staging, production) each with distinct resource allocations and scalability options ensuring minimal downtime and cost-efficiency.
2. Incorporate data persistence and backup strategies for MySQL to ensure data integrity and recovery. Detail the use of persistent volumes and stateful sets.
3. Implement security best practices, such as network policies and secrets management to protect sensitive information.
4. Create liveness and readiness probes for both 'wordpress' and 'mysql' containers to automate health checks and enhance system reliability.

Critically evaluate and justify each configuration choice based on performance implications, potential trade-offs, and environmental impact considerations. Also, discuss how you could leverage Kubernetes features to facilitate continuous integration and deployment of the application across the various environments."
