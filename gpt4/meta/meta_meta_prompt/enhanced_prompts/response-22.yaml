Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to establish a WordPress website with a high availability configuration, using a MySQL database as the backend. In this scenario:
1. The WordPress application should be named 'wordpress' and structured to support scaling across multiple pods to handle increasing traffic.
2. The MySQL database should be named 'mysql' and set up in a replicated master-slave architecture to ensure data persistence and robustness against single points of failure.
3. Outline the considerations for maintaining session consistency across the WordPress pods and ensure that any update to the database by one pod is promptly reflected across others.
4. Include provisions in your deployment strategy to handle potential scenarios such as sudden spikes in traffic and database failures.
5. Discuss how you would integrate monitoring tools and what metrics would be most critical to ensure that the deployment is functioning as expected and remains resilient under stress conditions.

By structuring your deployment this way, explain the potential trade-offs regarding cost, performance, and complexity and how you would address possible challenges that could arise during scaling and operational maintenance."
