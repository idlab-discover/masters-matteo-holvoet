Revised Prompt: "Design a comprehensive Kubernetes deployment strategy for a scalable WordPress website, utilizing a MySQL database for data management. Consider the following constraints and requirements:

1. Segregate the WordPress and MySQL services into distinct pods named 'wordpress' and 'mysql', respectively. Ensure each is deployable and scalable independently.
2. Incorporate security best practices for both WordPress and MySQL deployments, discussing potential vulnerabilities and the necessary preventative measures to mitigate them in a Kubernetes environment.
3. Outline a multi-stage deployment process, starting from a minimal viable product to full-scale deployment, with checkpoints for testing and quality assurance to ensure functionality at each stage.
4. Evaluate the impact of pod resource limits and requests on the performance and reliability of the WordPress site, theorizing optimal configurations.
5. Consider a scenario where database requests suddenly double - propose a scaling strategy for the MySQL database in response to this increase in demand.

Your approach should analyze, justify, and document each decision in the context of best practices in cloud architecture and Kubernetes deployments. This exercise is intended to challenge conventional deployment strategies and push the boundaries on performance, security, and scalability."
