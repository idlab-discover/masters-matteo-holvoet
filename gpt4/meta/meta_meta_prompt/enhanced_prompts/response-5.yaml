Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML configuration for deploying a highly available WordPress website utilizing a MySQL database as its primary data store. For this setup, assign 'wordpress' as the name for the WordPress container and 'mysql' for the MySQL container. Incorporate the following tasks in your design:

1. Evaluate and justify the choice of using StatefulSets over Deployments for the MySQL database given its need for persistent storage.
2. Propose a strategy for efficiently handling secret management for MySQL credentials within the Kubernetes environment.
3. Discuss and plan for potential database scaling issues that might arise with an increasing number of WordPress users. Include a load balancing approach for distributing user requests evenly across multiple WordPress instances.
4. Consider security best practices by explaining how to secure communication between the WordPress and MySQL containers.
5. Finally, reflect on the environmental impact of your chosen configuration and propose measures to reduce carbon footprint while maintaining optimal performance.

Ensure your proposal includes Kubernetes objects like Pods, Services, Volumes, and ConfigMaps, explaining the role and interdependencies of each in the context of your deployment scenario. Your design should reflect a deep understanding of Kubernetes architecture and demonstrate innovative thinking in deploying web applications in a cloud-native environment."
