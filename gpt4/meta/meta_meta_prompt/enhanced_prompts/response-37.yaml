**Revised Prompt**: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database. Consider the following constraints and optimizations: 

1. **Security Concerns**: Ensure both the "wordpress" container and the "mysql" container are configured with security best practices. What measures would you implement to secure sensitive data?
   
2. **Resource Efficiency**: With varying load expectations, outline how you would configure auto-scaling for the WordPress application. What metrics would you monitor, and how would these influence your scaling parameters?
   
3. **High Availability**: Architect this deployment to handle potential high traffic loads and ensure minimal downtime. How would you distribute traffic, and what redundancies would you put in place?

4. **Environmental Impact**: Suggest how you could reduce the carbon footprint of this deployment. Which decisions in your design could be optimized to be more environmentally friendly without compromising performance?

5. **Innovation Challenge**: The deployment scenario includes a global user base, with users in multiple geographical locations. Propose an innovative solution that could enhance user experience by decreasing latency or optimizing content delivery.

Each section should not only include the necessary configurations but also an explanation of the reasoning behind each choice. Analyze competing solutions and justify why you selected one approach over another. This task aims to build a robust, scalable, and secure application capable of adapting to varying digital environments."
