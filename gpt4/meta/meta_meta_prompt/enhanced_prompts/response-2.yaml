Revised Prompt: "Design a high-availability Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website interfaced with a MySQL database, ensuring data persistence and effective load handling. Consider the following multi-layered challenges: 
1. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql', and ensure these are configured to effectively communicate with each other.
2. Incorporate elements such as ConfigMaps for environment variable management and Secrets for secure storage of database credentials.
3. Devise a strategy using multi-zone deployment to ensure the application remains highly available and resilient to a zone failure.
4. Analyze potential security concerns that may arise from this configuration and propose mitigation strategies.
5. Evaluate how the chosen configurations impact resource allocation and scalability. Reflect on how different Kubernetes resources (like HPA, VPA, and node pools) can be optimized for cost and performance while meeting the expected load.
Your solution should account for potential growth in website traffic and address the principles of infrastructure as code in maintaining scalability and manageability. Discuss the thought process and rationale behind your architectural decisions, reflecting on the trade-offs and potential alternatives at each step."
