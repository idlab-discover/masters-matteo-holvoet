**Revised Prompt:** "Develop a Kubernetes YAML configuration to set up a WordPress website using a MySQL database, ensuring you follow best practices for security and efficiency. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Integrate the following complex elements: 

1. Implement Kubernetes secret management to securely handle database credentials.
2. Configure persistent volumes and persistent volume claims to manage data storage without losing data on container restarts.
3. Incorporate a strategy for scaling the WordPress site using Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler based on CPU usage thresholds.
4. Evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of using StatefulSets over Deployments for the MySQL database in this scenario.

Detail your reasoning process for each step, justify your choices based on performance and security implications, and discuss any alternative approaches you considered during the design. This will enhance your understanding of Kubernetes orchestration, data persistence, scaling mechanisms, and secure configuration management."
