Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a scalable WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. The tasks involve:

1. Configuring two separate pods, naming the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'.
2. Ensuring data persistence for MySQL through the strategic use of Kubernetes volumes.
3. Addressing potential security best practices and limitations concerning database access in a multi-user environment.
4. Implementing an auto-scaling solution for the WordPress pod based on traffic, and conserving resources during low traffic times.

Additionally, articulate the reasoning for the Kubernetes objects chosen for this configuration and how they interact. Predict and discuss potential challenges or failures that could arise from this setup and propose preventative or mitigative measures."
