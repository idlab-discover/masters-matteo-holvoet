Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to launch a WordPress site with an accompanying MySQL database backend, aiming for high availability and load balancing to manage varying traffic loads. Name the WordPress pod 'wordpress' and the MySQL pod 'mysql'. Additionally, consider scenarios including a sudden spike in traffic and a node failure. Detail how your configuration manages these challenges while ensuring minimal downtime and data integrity. Provide a reasonable justification for each design choice, including the selection of specific Kubernetes resources and configurations. How might the principles applied here be extrapolated to optimize other similar web application deployments?"
