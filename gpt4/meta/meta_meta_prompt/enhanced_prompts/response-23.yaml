Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes deployment architecture for a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend, ensuring high availability and cost efficiency. Specify the configurations by creating a detailed YAML manifest. Name the containers 'wordpress' for the WordPress application and 'mysql' for the MySQL database. Additionally, consider how you would scale the application for load changes, manage data persistence safely, and secure the communication between the WordPress and MySQL containers. Provide justifications for each major decision in your deployment strategy, exploring alternative approaches and their trade-offs." 

This revised prompt encourages a layered approach to Kubernetes deployment design, instigating a deeper exploration into system architecture, performance challenges, safety considerations, and cost-benefit analyses. It motivates the user to synthesize knowledge across various domains such as configuration management, database scaling, data security, and infrastructural economics, thereby enhancing their reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.
