Revised Prompt:
"Craft a detailed Kubernetes YAML manifest designed for deploying a WordPress website, utilizing a MySQL database for data management. Specifically configure the WordPress application in a container named 'wordpress' and the MySQL in a container named 'mysql'. Your task includes designing a resilient architecture considering potential high-traffic scenarios. Include provisions for scalability, load balancing, and data persistence. Analyze and justify the choice of each resource type and configuration parameter in your manifest, discussing the expected outcomes in terms of resource allocation, efficiency, and performance under varying load conditions. Additionally, explore and discuss at least two alternative database solutions that could replace MySQL, providing reasoning for their suitability or unsuitability based on specific deployment contexts and requirements."
