Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a scalable WordPress website, supported by a MySQL database, in a simulated environment with fluctuating network traffic and varying user load. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Additionally, integrate the following tasks into your design process:

1. Justify the choice of resources allocated to the WordPress and MySQL containers considering cost-efficiency and performance optimization.
2. Develop a strategy to ensure data persistence for the MySQL database during unexpected pod failures.
3. Propose a mechanism to dynamically scale the WordPress service based on real-time traffic analysis, ensuring that the configured policy balances system responsiveness with resource consumption.
4. Evaluate potential security vulnerabilities in the described setup and suggest appropriate countermeasures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

Conclude your design with a discussion on the potential challenges and limitations of your proposed solution in a real-world scenario. Include considerations for future enhancements to adapt to evolving technology trends and user demands."
