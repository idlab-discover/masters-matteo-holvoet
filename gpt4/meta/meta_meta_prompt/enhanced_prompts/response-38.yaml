Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website integrated with a MySQL database as the backend, ensuring high availability and scalability. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Additionally, consider the following scenarios and constraints: 

1. The deployment should be capable of efficiently handling sudden spikes in traffic without human intervention. Discuss the strategies that can be used in Kubernetes to accommodate such changes.
2. Explore the security implications of connecting WordPress with MySQL and propose a solution to securely store and manage sensitive configuration details, such as passwords and keys.
3. Assess the impact of using stateless versus stateful architectures for both the WordPress and SQL containers in this scenario, and justify your choices for each.
4. Lastly, anticipate potential challenges that might arise from scaling this deployment, including database synchronization issues and propose preventive measures to mitigate these risks.

In your solution, articulate the reasoning behind each decision and how it contributes to overall system resilience and performance. Include critical considerations from the fields of cybersecurity, devops, and database administration in your analysis."
