Below, I have created a Kubernetes manifest that defines all the required components for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database. I'll go through the components one by one, addressing the requirements such as Deployments, Services, PersistentVolumeClaims, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.

### Step 1: Define the Secret for MySQL Credentials

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: <base64-encoded-password>
---
```
**Explanation**: The password for MySQL is stored as a base64-encoded string. You will need to replace `<base64-encoded-password>` with your actual base64-encoded password. For example, if your password is "mysecretpassword", you can encode it using the command: `echo -n 'mysecretpassword' | base64`.

### Step 2: Define a ConfigMap for MySQL and WordPress Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mysql-config
data:
  user: "root"
---
```

**Explanation**: This ConfigMap stores configuration such as the MySQL user. We are assuming `root` in this example.

### Step 3: Define PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL Persistence

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
---
```

**Explanation**: This defines a persistent volume claim named `mysql-pv-claim` with a request for 20 GB of storage.

### Step 4: Define the MySQL Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.6
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-config
              key: user
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
---
```

**Explanation**: This MySQL Deployment uses the `mysql:5.6` image. It reads environment variables from the Secret and ConfigMap, mounts a volume for data persistence, and opens port 3306.

### Step 5: Define the MySQL Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
---
```

**Explanation**: This creates a headless service for MySQL that allows other pods to connect to it using the DNS name `mysql`.

### Step 6: Define the WordPress Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-config
              key: user
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
```

**Explanation**: This WordPress Deployment uses the `wordpress:latest` image and configures it to connect to the MySQL service. It exposes port 80.

### Step 7: Define the WordPress Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer
---
```

**Explanation**: This service makes the WordPress application accessible through a load balancer, automatically provisioning an external IP to access the application.

### Final Notes

This manifest should be saved to a file and can be deployed using `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml`. Ensure that secrets and config data are securely managed and that the manifest meets the requirements of your production environment in terms of replication, resource limits, and other security settings.
