Sure! We will craft a Kubernetes YAML manifest file that accommodates your specification. This file will contain configurations for Deployments, Services, PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), a ConfigMap, and a Secret to set up WordPress and MySQL effectively. Below, I will break down the pieces and then combine them into one comprehensive YAML file.

### Step 1: Define Secret for MySQL Credentials

Create a Secret to hold sensitive data like the MySQL root password.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD
```

Replace `YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD` with a Base64-encoded password.

### Step 2: Define ConfigMap for MySQL and WordPress Configuration

We'll set up a ConfigMap for non-sensitive configurations.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mysql-wordpress-config
data:
  mysql-database: wordpress_db
  mysql-user: wp_user
```

### Step 3: MySQL Deployment and Service

We will deploy MySQL with a PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-wordpress-config
              key: mysql-database
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-wordpress-config
              key: mysql-user
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```

### Step 4: WordPress Deployment and Service

Deploy WordPress, connecting it to the MySQL service.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-wordpress-config
              key: mysql-user
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mysql-wordpress-config
              key: mysql-database
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

### Complete Manifest

Combine all these parts into a single YAML file, separated by `---` to differentiate between resources in Kubernetes. Remember to manage the order intelligently, creating Secrets and ConfigMaps before referencing them in Deployments.

This setup should give you a functional WordPress application backed by a MySQL database, correctly modularized and configured for basic operations in a Kubernetes environment. Don't forget to apply security best practices and adjust configurations according to your actual requirements before deploying to a production environment.
