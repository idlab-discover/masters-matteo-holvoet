This YAML file is designed for efficiency and clarity, separating each component clearly with document separators (`---`). You should apply this file to your Kubernetes cluster with either `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml` if saved as a file, or by pasting it directly into the kubectl command line utility using `kubectl apply -f -` and then pasting the configuration.
