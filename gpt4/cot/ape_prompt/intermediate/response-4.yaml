Creating a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend involves several components: a MySQL deployment, a WordPress deployment, Services for both deployments, and Persistent Volumes to store their data persistently. We'll create these resources step-by-step using separate YAML configurations for clarity.

### Step 1: MySQL Persistent Volume Claim
We'll start by creating a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for MySQL to ensure that the data survives pod restarts.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
```

### Step 2: MySQL Deployment
Here, we create a deployment for MySQL, referencing the PVC we just declared. We will use environment variables to set the MySQL root password.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword  # Use secrets in production
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Step 3: MySQL Service
Next, we expose the MySQL database internally within the cluster using a Kubernetes Service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
```

### Step 4: WordPress Persistent Volume Claim
Similarly to MySQL, we create a PVC for WordPress.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

### Step 5: WordPress Deployment
Now, set up the WordPress deployment referencing its own PVC and linking to the MySQL database created earlier.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword  # Use secrets in production
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pv-claim
```

### Step 6: WordPress Service
Finally, create a Service for WordPress to expose it to external traffic, typically on port 80.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer
```

This setup stores persistent data for both MySQL and WordPress, places a password directly in the YAML (please replace this with a Kubernetes Secret in production environments), and ensures communication between the two applications. This setup should work on any standard Kubernetes cluster, such as Minikube or a managed Kubernetes service like AWS EKS, Google GKE, or Azure AKS.
