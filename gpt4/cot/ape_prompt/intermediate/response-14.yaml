Sure! To deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database using Kubernetes, we can use two Deployments and associated Services to manage and expose the WordPress instance and the MySQL database. Here, I'll guide you through the creation of the necessary Kubernetes YAML manifest in several parts:

1. **MySQL Database Deployment and Persistent Volume**: We will create a Deployment for MySQL, along with a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for data persistence.

2. **MySQL Service**: To expose the MySQL database within the cluster so that WordPress can access it.

3. **WordPress Deployment**: Like the MySQL component, WordPress will also have its own Deployment and PVC for persistent storage.

4. **WordPress Service**: To expose WordPress to users over the internet.

### Step 1: MySQL Database Deployment and Persistent Volume Claim

We'll start by creating a `PersistentVolumeClaim` and a `Deployment` object for MySQL:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Step 2: MySQL Service

Next, define a Service to expose MySQL:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
```

### Step 3: WordPress Deployment and Persistent Volume Claim

Now, let's create the Deployment and PVC for WordPress:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wp-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wp-pv-claim
```

### Step 4: WordPress Service

Finally, expose the WordPress application using a Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

### Notes

- Replace `"yourpassword"` with a secure password.
- The WordPress and MySQL deployments use PVCs for data persistence.
- We expose WordPress using a `LoadBalancer`, which makes it accessible from the internet. For more security and control, consider using an `Ingress` with TLS/SSL configuration.
- In a production environment, use better secrets management for sensitive information like database passwords, possibly using Kubernetes Secrets or a more secure third-party vault solution.

With this configuration, you can deploy your WordPress and MySQL setup on a Kubernetes cluster. Use `kubectl apply -f <filename.yaml>` to apply this YAML file.
