Sure, here's a single YAML file that encapsulates the entire deployment for both WordPress and MySQL on Kubernetes, formatted and designed as per your instructions:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1

  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce

### Key Points:
1. **Persistent Volume Claims**: Both services have their own claims to ensure that data persists.
2. **Deployments**: MySQL and WordPress are set up with essential configurations including environment variables for connectivity and operational parameters.
3. **Services**: MySQL's service is an internal-only (ClusterIP) service facilitating connection within the cluster, and WordPress's service is a LoadBalancer to expose the app externally.
4. **Security Note**: Be mindful that using plain text for secrets like MySQL passwords is not recommended in production environments. Kubernetes Secrets or other encrypted storage solutions should be utilized.

This configuration provides a basic but comprehensive setup for running WordPress with a MySQL backend on Kubernetes. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific Kubernetes environment or requirements.
