Certainly! Below is the consolidated YAML file containing all resources required to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL backend in Kubernetes. Make sure to replace `"yourpassword"` with a strong password, and preferably use Kubernetes secrets to manage your credentials securely in production environments.

This single YAML file encapsulates the complete deployment setup for WordPress with MySQL in Kubernetes. It includes Persistent Volume Claims for data persistence, deployments for both applications, and services for networking. Use this file with caution in a real environment, ensuring secure password management and compliance with best practices.
