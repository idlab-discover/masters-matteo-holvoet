Certainly! Below is the single combined YAML file containing all the necessary resources to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL backend in Kubernetes. This includes Secrets, Deployments, Services, and PersistentVolumeClaims in one unified manifest.

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD_HERE` with the base64 encoded password for MySQL.
- Ensure that your Kubernetes cluster can dynamically provision Persistent Volumes or that you have pre-provisioned volumes available.
- The deployment exposes WordPress externally using a LoadBalancer service, which works out of the box in most cloud environments but may need different configurations for on-premise or bare-metal clusters.
- Review the storage requirements and adjust the size in the `PersistentVolumeClaim` resources as needed based on your anticipated data.

To deploy this configuration, save the YAML into a file (e.g., `wordpress-mysql.yml`) and run:

```sh
kubectl apply -f wordpress-mysql.yml
```

This will create all the resources in sequence as defined in the file, setting up your WordPress site connected to a MySQL database.
