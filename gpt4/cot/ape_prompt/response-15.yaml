Below is the well-structured Kubernetes YAML file that helps in setting up both MySQL and WordPress. This single YAML file contains the definitions for Secrets, PersistentVolumeClaims, Deployments, and Services for both WordPress and MySQL, in a clear and organized way.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD # Replace YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD with your base64-encoded password

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce

    requests:

              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

apiVersion: v1

    app: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### Notes:
1. Ensure you replace `YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD` with a valid base64-encoded password. You can generate this by running `echo -n 'your-password' | base64` in your terminal.
2. The assumption here is your Kubernetes cluster supports the automatic provisioning of storage via `PersistentVolumeClaims` and can handle `LoadBalancer` services automatically as well.
3. Before deploying the YAML file, make sure your cluster is properly configured to allocate the necessary resources like storage and load balancer.
4. Deploy the above configuration with `kubectl apply -f filename.yaml`, where `filename.yaml` is the name of the file where you save the above contents.
5. Remember to check all the resources for correct status using `kubectl get all` to ensure everything is running smoothly.

This configuration should be a good starting point for deploying WordPress with a MySQL backend on Kubernetes. Make sure to adapt it according to your specific cloud or local environment needs.
