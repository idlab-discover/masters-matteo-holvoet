Here is a complete YAML manifest that deploys a WordPress website with a MySQL backend on Kubernetes. This setup includes the necessary resources like PersistentVolumeClaims, Deployments, and Services.

```yaml

        persistentVolumeClaim:

```

### Important Notes:
- **Security**: Ensure you replace `"yourpassword"` with a strong, secure password. Even better, handle these credentials using Kubernetes secrets.
- **Persistence**: The PersistentVolumeClaims here are basic. In a production environment, you might need specific storage classes or more tailored configurations.
- **Services**: Depending on where you deploy this (a local environment vs cloud provider), the service type for WordPress might need to be adjusted. If running locally, consider using `NodePort` or `ClusterIP` with port forwarding instead of `LoadBalancer`.
- **Resource Limits**: For real workloads, define resource requests and limits in your container specifications to ensure pods are given the resources they need and do not consume more than their share. 

This combined YAML file provides a straightforward method to deploy WordPress with MySQL on Kubernetes.
