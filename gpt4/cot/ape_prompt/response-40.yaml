Below is the consolidated Kubernetes YAML manifest which includes all the necessary componentsâ€”Persistent Volume Claims, a Secret, Deployments for MySQL and WordPress, and Services to expose these deployments. This setup is suited for a basic WordPress site with a MySQL backend on a Kubernetes cluster:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass

data:
  password: <YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD> # Replace <YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD> with your actual base64-encoded password.

Make sure to replace `<YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD>` with the actual base64-encoded password after encoding your desired MySQL root password using `echo -n "yourpassword" | base64`. This command should be executed in a shell that supports them, such as Bash.

Furthermore, if you're deploying this in environments like minikube or other non-cloud setups, you might need to adjust service types since `LoadBalancer` might not be supported. In such cases, using `NodePort` or working through an Ingress might be necessary. 

This setup assumes that your Kubernetes environment supports dynamic volume provisioning or that you have predefined persistent volumes that match the PVC requests. If your cluster does not manage volumes automatically, you'll need to manually create and manage these resources or adapt the storage specifications according to your environment's capabilities.
