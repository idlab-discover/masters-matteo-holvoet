Certainly! Here is a combined single YAML file that includes all components needed to deploy WordPress and MySQL on a Kubernetes cluster. This file will define the Secret, Deployments, Persistent Volume Claims, and Services required for a basic WordPress site hosted with a MySQL database.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque

  password: YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD

  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce

    requests:

              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pvc

apiVersion: v1

  type: LoadBalancer
```

Keep in mind the following when using this YAML:
1. The password in the Secret needs to be Base64 encoded.
2. Adjust the PVCs (PersistentVolumeClaims) as per the available PersistentVolume configurations in your environment or your specific storage needs.
3. Verify your permissions and Kubernetes cluster configuration to ensure that LoadBalancers and PVCs are supported.

This YAML provides a foundational setup. You should adapt and expand upon it depending on your specific requirements such as adding Readiness and Liveness Probes, configuring more sophisticated resource requests, or implementing better security practices.
