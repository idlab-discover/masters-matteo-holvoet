Certainly! Below is a combined YAML file containing all the necessary Kubernetes resources to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database. This includes the setup of persistent volumes (using claims), deployments, secrets, and services.

```yaml

### Instructions:

1. **Edit the Base64 Encoded Password**: Replace `BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD` with your own MySQL root password in base64 format.

2. **Deployment**: To deploy this setup to your Kubernetes cluster, save the above content into a file (e.g., `wordpress-mysql-deployment.yaml`) and use the command:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f wordpress-mysql-deployment.yaml
   ```

3. **Check on Deployments**: Ensure your resources are correctly deployed by running `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get svc` to see the status of pods and services.

This configuration is suitable for basic deployments and serves well for learning and development environments. For production environments, consider additional security measures, configuration adjustments, and resource optimizations.
