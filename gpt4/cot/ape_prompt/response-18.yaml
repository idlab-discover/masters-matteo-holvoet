Certainly! Below is a consolidated YAML file incorporating all the configurations for deploying WordPress with a MySQL backend on Kubernetes. This file includes the Persistent Volume Claims, Secret, Deployments, and Services required.

**Note:** Don't forget to substitute `<your-base64-encoded-password>` with the actual base64-encoded password you intend to use. This can be generated by running `echo -n 'my-password' | base64` in your command line, replacing `my-password` with your desired password.

You can now apply this configuration to your Kubernetes cluster by saving it into a file (for example `wordpress-mysql.yaml`) and then using `kubectl apply -f wordpress-mysql.yaml`. This will set up both the WordPress and MySQL applications, along with their necessary services and storage.
