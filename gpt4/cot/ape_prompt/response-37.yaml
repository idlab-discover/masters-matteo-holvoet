Sure, here is the single YAML file that includes both deployments for MySQL and WordPress, their respective PVCs, and services all combined. This setup should get your WordPress site up and running with a MySQL backend on a Kubernetes cluster.

### How to Deploy

1. Save the above content to a file named `wordpress-mysql.yaml`.
2. Apply this configuration to your Kubernetes cluster by running:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f wordpress-mysql.yaml
   ```
3. Check the deployment status and ensure all pods are running. Adjust configurations such as storage size and secrets management according to your operational environment.

This setup will expose WordPress through a NodePort, which makes WordPress accessible via a port on your cluster nodes. For production, consider securing your MySQL instance more tightly and using a LoadBalancer service type or Ingress for the WordPress service.
