Certainly! Below is a complete Kubernetes YAML configuration file that orchestrates both the MySQL and WordPress deployments, along with their required services and persistent volume claims. This setup assumes that you're deploying within an environment that supports PersistentVolumeClaims and LoadBalancer services (common in most cloud environments).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim

  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce

        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE

          mountPath: /var/www/html

### Instructions for Deployment:
1. Save this configuration into a YAML file, for example, `wordpress-mysql-deployment.yaml`.
2. Apply this configuration by running the command: `kubectl apply -f wordpress-mysql-deployment.yaml`.
3. Check the status using `kubectl get svc,deploy,pods,pvc` to ensure all components are correctly created and running.
4. Once the LoadBalancer is provisioned, use its IP or DNS name to access your WordPress site.

Ensure to replace `yourpassword` with a strong password to secure your MySQL database. Adjust other parameters such as storage sizes according to your actual needs and constraints.
