Certainly! Here is a consolidated YAML document that orchestrates the deployment of WordPress and MySQL on Kubernetes, including the persistent volume claims, deployments, and services. The complete configuration is provided in a single YAML file as requested:

### Instructions:
1. Ensure that Kubernetes is installed and configured on your environment.
2. Save this YAML content into a file, for example, `wordpress-mysql-deployment.yml`.
3. Deploy to your Kubernetes cluster using the command:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f wordpress-mysql-deployment.yml
    ```
4. Monitor deployment status using:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get services
    ```
5. Access your WordPress installation via the external IP provided by the LoadBalancer service.

This YAML file covers the deployment of a WordPress instance with a MySQL database, creating persistent volumes for persistent data storage, setting up internal networking with services, and allowing external access to WordPress through a LoadBalancer type service. Remember to change sensitive data and configure according to your security policies in a production environment.
