Certainly! Below is a consolidated YAML file containing the entire setup for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend as discussed. Everything is encapsulated in a single YAML document, which includes creating secrets, persistent volume claims, deployments, and services for both WordPress and MySQL.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD  # Replace with your Base64 encoded password

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
      tier: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate

        tier: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: mysql:5.6
        name: mysql
        env:

          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:

        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
      tier: frontend
  template:

        env:

          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pv-claim

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: wordpress
    tier: mysql
  clusterIP: None

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
    tier: frontend
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### Notes:
- Make sure to replace `YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD` with a Base64-encoded version of your desired MySQL root password.
- Review and adjust volume sizes according to your environment and needs.
- The MySQL service has a `ClusterIP: None` to make it a headless service, useful for stable network identities.
- The WordPress service type is set to `LoadBalancer` to facilitate external access, this will work if your Kubernetes environment supports automatic load balancer provisioning, typical in cloud environments like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

This comprehensive YAML setup is ready for deployment in your Kubernetes environment, assuming storage and networking interfaces are configured to support these kinds of deployments.
