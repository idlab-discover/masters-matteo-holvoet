Certainly! Below is a complete and consolidated Kubernetes YAML file that includes all necessary components to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL backend in Kubernetes. This single file has all necessary definitions to set up the persistent volume claims, deployments, and services.

**Important Notes:**
1. **Security**: `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` should be managed securely, especially in production. Consider using Kubernetes Secrets to manage sensitive data securely.
2. **Storage Requests**: Adjust the PVC storage requests according to expected data size and growth estimations.
3. **Deployment Strategy**: MySQL uses `Recreate` strategy to ensure that thereâ€™s no more than one pod running during redeployment. This is crucial for a single-instance MySQL deployment to prevent data corruption.

This YAML file is now ready to be applied into a Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml`, assuming appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) and other cluster permissions are already configured.
