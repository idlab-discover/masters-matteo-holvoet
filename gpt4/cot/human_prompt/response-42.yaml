Below is the consolidated YAML file containing all the necessary configurations for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend on a Kubernetes cluster. This single file includes definitions for Persistent Volume Claims, Secrets, Deployments for both MySQL and WordPress, and Services to expose these applications.

```

This YAML file lays out all the necessary resources to deploy and manage a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend in a Kubernetes environment. The WordPress application is exposed externally using a LoadBalancer service, making it accessible from the internet. Make sure to double-check all base64 encoded values like usernames and passwords to ensure they decode to the intended strings, and ensure that your Kubernetes environment supports the LoadBalancer service type, or adjust accordingly to fit your cluster's capabilities.
