Certainly! To set up a WordPress website using MySQL as the backend in Kubernetes, you can use the following declarations in the YAML files:

1. **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):** You will need persistent storage for both MySQL and WordPress to ensure that the data survives pod restarts.
2. **Deployments:** Define deployments for both MySQL and WordPress.
3. **Services:** Services to expose the pods internally and externally.

Here is a basic setup:

### Step 1: PersistentVolumeClaims
Persistent Volume Claims for MySQL and WordPress.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

### Step 2: MySQL Deployment
Deployment for MySQL with the claim for persistence.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.6
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Step 3: WordPress Deployment
Deployment for WordPress pointing to the MySQL service.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql:3306
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pv-claim
```

### Step 4: Services
Define services to expose MySQL and WordPress.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

### Explanation

1. **PersistentVolumeClaims:** This will create two PVCs â€“ one for MySQL and one for WordPress.
2. **MySQL Deployment:** This deploys a MySQL instance with environment variables set to configure the root password and a database named `wordpress`.
3. **WordPress Deployment:** This deploys WordPress with environment variables to connect to the MySQL service using the database details.
4. **Services:** The MySQL service is an internal ClusterIP service, while the WordPress service is an external LoadBalancer type that exposes WordPress to the internet.

This YAML structure forms the basic deployment scenario for a WordPress website using Kubernetes. You can adjust the resource requests and other parameters according to your requirements. Make sure to replace `yourpassword` with a secure password.
