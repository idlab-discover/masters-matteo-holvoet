Sure, we can create a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. This will involve several components:

1. **MySQL Deployment**: A deployment that manages the MySQL container.
2. **WordPress Deployment**: A deployment that manages the WordPress container.
3. **Persistent Volumes** (PV) and **Persistent Volume Claims** (PVC) to ensure data persists even if the services are restarted.
4. **Services**: To expose and load balance access to the WordPress and MySQL from within the cluster.

### Step 1: Define the Persistent Volume Claims

First, we need to create persistent volume claims for MySQL and WordPress to ensure their data can survive pod recreation.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

### Step 2: MySQL Deployment

Next, create a deployment for the MySQL database.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:5.7
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: yourpassword
            - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
              value: wordpress
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3306
          volumeMounts:
            - name: mysql-storage
              mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
        - name: mysql-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

### Step 3: WordPress Deployment

Here's the deployment manifest for WordPress.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
              value: root
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
              value: yourpassword
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
              value: wordpress
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          volumeMounts:
            - name: wordpress-storage
              mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
        - name: wordpress-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: wordpress-pv-claim
```

### Step 4: Define Services

Finally, define the services for MySQL and WordPress for communication between these components.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - port: 3306
  clusterIP: None

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - port: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### Full Manifest

Combine all these snippets into a single YAML file to define your Kubernetes deployment for WordPress with a MySQL backend. Before applying this configuration, make sure the environment (like secrets for database credentials) and persistent volumes suit your cluster setup. This YAML is a starting point and might need adaptations for specific environments, such as cloud-specific persistent volume provisioning and security configurations.
