Sure, let's break down the task of creating a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying WordPress with a MySQL backend into components. Below, I'll outline the necessary Kubernetes resources, including:

1. **Secrets** for storing sensitive data such as database passwords.
2. **PersistentVolumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)** for data persistence.
3. **Deployments** for WordPress and MySQL to manage the pods and their lifecycles.
4. **Services** to enable network access to the WordPress instance and for internal database connectivity.

Here's a step-by-step explanation followed by the complete YAML file:

### Step 1: Define the Secret
A Kubernetes Secret is used to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords. This is crucial to avoid hardcoding sensitive data directly into the deployment YAML files.

### Step 2: Define Persistent Volumes
Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) are necessary for data persistence beyond the lifecycle of specific pods. MySQL will need a volume to store the database files, and WordPress might need a volume for media storage.

### Step 3: Create Deployments
Create two separate deployments: one for MySQL and another for WordPress. Each Deployment will ensure that the respective container (MySQL or WordPress) remains running as specified.

### Step 4: Define Services
Services in Kubernetes provide stable network addresses for your pods, allowing them to communicate with other pods and the outside world.

### Combined YAML Deployment

Here's how the YAML manifest might look based on the above steps:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: base64encodedpassword # Replace with actual base64 encoded password

  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce

    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

apiVersion: v1

  name: wordpress-pv-claim

        env:

          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  strategy:
    type: Recreate

    metadata:
      labels:

    spec:
      containers:

        name: wordpress
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pv-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### Explanation
1. **Secret**: We store the MySQL root password encrypted in base64.
2. **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)**: These claims request physical storage from Kubernetes.
3. **Deployments**: Two separate deployments for MySQL and WordPress. Note how MySQL password is fetched from secrets.
4. **Services**: Services are defined for MySQL and WordPress. Notice the use of `LoadBalancer` for WordPress to expose it externally. MySQL doesn't need external access, so its service is just for internal use.

Be sure to replace `base64encodedpassword` with a real base64 encoded password. Use commands like `echo -n 'yourpassword' | base64` to generate it. Additionally, consider your environment's specifics, like whether it supports LoadBalancers, when adapting this example.
