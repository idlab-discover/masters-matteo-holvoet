To deploy WordPress and MySQL on Kubernetes using separate containers within pods, along with the necessary persistent storage and networking, we typically use several Kubernetes resources including Deployments, Services, PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), ConfigMaps, and Secrets.

Here is a step-by-step approach to creating a basic setup:

1. **Persistent Volumes/Claims:** Both WordPress and MySQL require persistent storage to maintain data across pod restarts and failures.
2. **ConfigMap:** Used for configuring MySQL database parameters.
3. **Secret:** For storing sensitive information such as database username and password.
4. **Deployment:** For deploying MySQL and WordPress containers.
5. **Service:** To expose MySQL and WordPress pods to network traffic.

Below is the detailed Kubernetes YAML manifest which incorporates these resources:

### Explanation:

1. **PersistentVolumeClaims:** Used to request physical storage from Kubernetes. We specify PVCs for both MySQL and WordPress.
   
2. **Secret:** Contains sensitive password information encoded in Base64. This needs to be created and managed securely.

3. **Deployments:** `wordpress` and `mysql` deployments describe the desired states of pods including which image to use, which ports to open, and which environment variables to set using secrets.

4. **Services:** We expose MySQL internally within the cluster so that only WordPress can access it. WordPress is exposed externally via a `LoadBalancer` (ideal for cloud environments), allowing traffic on port 80.

Make sure to replace `<base64-encoded-password>`, `<base64-encoded-username>`, and `<base64-encoded-user-password>` with your actual base64-encoded credentials. This can be accomplished by running a command like `echo -n 'yourpassword' | base64` in your terminal.
