To deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database on Kubernetes, we'll need a few components:

1. A MySQL deployment with a Persistent Volume for data persistence.
2. A WordPress deployment which connects to the MySQL database.
3. Services to expose both MySQL and WordPress pods to each other and possibly to the outside world.

For the datastore, it would be prudent to use PersistentVolumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC) to ensure the data is preserved across container restarts.

Below is a step-by-step Kubernetes manifest file that accomplishes the setup. This example assumes that you have a default StorageClass configured in your cluster. If not, you may need to adjust the PersistentVolume configuration accordingly.

### Step 1: MySQL Deployment and Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: wordpress
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```

### Step 2: WordPress Deployment and Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: wordpress
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: wordpress
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pv-claim

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

### Summary

This configuration sets up:
- Persistent storage using PVCs for both MySQL and WordPress.
- MySQL and WordPress deployments, each configured with the appropriate environment variables.
- Services to expose MySQL only to the WordPress pod and WordPress to the outside world using a LoadBalancer (which is the typical setup for a production environment).

Remember to adjust resource requests, replicas, environment variables, and other configurations as necessary to match your specific requirements and environment.
