Here is a single YAML file that incorporates all the previously explained components necessary to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend in a Kubernetes cluster. The file includes a secret, persistent volume claims, deployments, and services, all in the correct order.

This YAML file sets everything up in a Kubernetes environment with all components being adequately linked and secured. Make sure to replace `base64encodedpassword` with the actual base64 encoded string for the MySQL password that you would like to use (`echo -n 'yourpassword' | base64`). 

Also, ensure that you have a Kubernetes cluster with enough resources and the necessary permissions to create these resources. Apply this configuration using a command like `kubectl apply -f filename.yaml`.
