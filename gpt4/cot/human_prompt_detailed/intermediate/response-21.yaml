Sure! Let's build the Kubernetes YAML manifest step by step, including all the necessary resources for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database. I'll explain each part of the manifest as we go along.

1. **ConfigMap and Secrets**: We'll start by defining a ConfigMap for MySQL and a Secret to handle sensitive data like the MySQL root password and the database name, user, and password that WordPress will use to connect to MySQL.

2. **MySQL Deployment and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**: We will set up a Deployment for MySQL, including a persistent volume to ensure data persistence.

3. **WordPress Deployment**: We will then tackle the WordPress Deployment, setting it up to use the database credentials stored in the Secret and connect to the MySQL service.

4. **Services**: Finally, we will define services for both WordPress and MySQL to allow network access to both the frontend and the database.

### Explanation:
- **ConfigMap & Secret**: These hold configuration and sensitive data respectively. Secrets are Base64 encoded.
- **PersistentVolumeClaim**: Ensures data persistence for the MySQL database.
- **Deployments**: There are separate deployments for MySQL and WordPress. Each reads from the ConfigMap and Secret as needed.
- **Services**: Defined for both applications. WordPress service is exposed on a NodePort (assuming this is for a minikube or similar local setup) to allow external access.

This should provide a full setup to deploy WordPress with a MySQL backend on Kubernetes. Make sure you apply this YAML with appropriate Kubernetes commands in your environment.
