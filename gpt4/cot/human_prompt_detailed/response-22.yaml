Sure! Here's the combined YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend, including the database credentials stored as Kubernetes secrets, persistent storage for MySQL data, and appropriate services for both applications:

```yaml

**Note:**
- Replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD` with your actual password encoded in Base64 to keep this information secret. You can generate a Base64 encoded string by running `echo -n "yourpassword" | base64` from your command line if you're on Linux, macOS, or using WSL on Windows.
- Carefully review storage needs and environment specifics; for a production environment, consider aspects like resource requests, limits, and optimized images. Additionally, you might want to manage services with Ingress for better traffic control and handling TLS/SSL certificates.

This manifest is designed for simplicity and demonstration; assess and modify accordingly for more security and performance modifications based on your operational environment and requirements.
