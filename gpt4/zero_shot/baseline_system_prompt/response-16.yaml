Based on your request, below are the Kubernetes YAML manifests to deploy a WordPress website with MySQL as its database backend. This example includes a Deployment and a Service for both WordPress and MySQL. The manifest assumes the use of Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to manage storage for durability.

This configuration sets up MySQL and WordPress with persistent storage and a load balancer for the WordPress service to make it available externally. Remember to change `yourpassword` to the actual password you want to use for the MySQL root user and WordPress database access. Modify other configuration details as necessary to fit your environment.
