PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

  /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
  /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h mysql-555f6b765f-n59dt password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:

  /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the manual for more instructions.

Please report any problems at http://bugs.mysql.com/

Please make sure your config file is current

WARNING: Default config file /etc/mysql/my.cnf exists on the system
This file will be read by default by the MySQL server
If you do not want to use this, either remove it, or use the
--defaults-file argument to mysqld_safe when starting the server
