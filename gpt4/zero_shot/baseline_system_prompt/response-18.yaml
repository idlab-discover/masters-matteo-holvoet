Below are Kubernetes YAML manifests for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database as its backend. The deployment is split into several parts: MySQL deployment, WordPress deployment, and required services for both.

First, we create a MySQL deployment and its corresponding service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

Next, here's how to deploy WordPress and expose it through a service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: LoadBalancer
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: yourpassword
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pvc
```

Note that the MySQL password is set as an environment variable, and both WordPress and MySQL use PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) which should be created according to your cluster's storage configuration, ensuring data persistence. Adjust the values like `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` and the claims for persistent volumes according to your secure and specific configuration needs.
