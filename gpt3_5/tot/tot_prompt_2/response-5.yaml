```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-deployment
```

Expert 1: Let's start by creating a Namespace to isolate our WordPress and MySQL deployment for organizational and security purposes. This will help us keep the resources related to our application separate from others in the cluster.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
  namespace: wordpress-mysql-deployment
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Expert 2: To ensure data persistence for the MySQL database, let's create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that MySQL can use to store its data. This PVC will request 1Gi of storage to hold MySQL's data and will be specific to our WordPress and MySQL deployment namespace.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
  namespace: wordpress-mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: "your_password_here"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3306
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
              name: mysql-persistent-storage
      volumes:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

Expert 3: Great start on the PVC! Let's move on to creating the MySQL Deployment. In this Deployment manifest, we define a single replica of the MySQL pod, set environment variables including the MySQL root password, expose port 3306 for MySQL connections, and mount the persistent storage from the PVC we created earlier to store database data.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
  namespace: wordpress-mysql-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
  type: ClusterIP
```

Expert 1: To allow the WordPress container to communicate with the MySQL backend, we need to create a Service for MySQL. This Service will expose port 3306 internally within the cluster, allowing other pods to access the MySQL database.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
  namespace: wordpress-mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql-service
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
              value: root
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
              value: your_password_here
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
              value: wordpress
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

Expert 2: Now let's define the WordPress Deployment. We set up one replica of the WordPress pod, configure environment variables to connect to the MySQL backend using the MySQL service DNS name, set credentials, and specify the database name. We expose port 80 for accessing the WordPress website.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
  namespace: wordpress-mysql-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
```

Expert 3: To allow external access to our WordPress website, we need to create a Service for WordPress. This Service will expose port 80 externally using NodePort, making the WordPress site accessible from outside the cluster.

This comprehensive manifest setup deploys a WordPress website backed by a MySQL database in a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring data persistence, connectivity between the WordPress and MySQL containers, and external access to the WordPress site.
