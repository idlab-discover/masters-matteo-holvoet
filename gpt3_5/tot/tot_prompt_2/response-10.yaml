```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql:5.7
      env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password123
```
Expert 1: Here I've created a Kubernetes Pod manifest named "mysql-pod" with a MySQL container named "mysql". I've specified the MySQL 5.7 image and set the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```
Expert 2: I've defined a Kubernetes Service named "mysql-service" targeting pods with the label "app: mysql". The Service will expose port 3306 for MySQL.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql-service
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
              value: wordpress
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
              value: root
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
              value: password123
```
Expert 3: I've created a Deployment manifest for WordPress with a WordPress container named "wordpress". The container uses the WordPress image and specifies environment variables for connecting to the MySQL backend. The WORDPRESS_DB_HOST is set to "mysql-service", which will resolve to the ClusterIP of the MySQL Service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```
Expert 1: To expose the WordPress application outside the cluster, we can create a NodePort Service named "wordpress-service" targeting pods with the label "app: wordpress" on port 80. This will allow external access to the WordPress website.

By collaboratively refining and building upon each other's manifests for MySQL and WordPress, we have successfully created a complete Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website using a MySQL database as the backend.
