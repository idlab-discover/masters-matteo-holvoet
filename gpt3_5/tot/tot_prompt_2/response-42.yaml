```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql:latest
      env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: secret
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
```

Expert 1: "I am starting by creating a Pod manifest for the MySQL container. I've named it 'mysql-pod' and specified the container name as 'mysql'. I set the MySQL image to 'mysql:latest' and added environment variables for the root password and MySQL database name."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```

Expert 2: "I am creating a Service manifest for the MySQL container. I set the service name as 'mysql-service' and selected the Pod with the label 'app: mysql'. I exposed port 3306 for the MySQL service."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
```

Expert 3: "I see the need for a Deployment manifest for the WordPress container. I've named it 'wordpress-deployment' with one replica and set the selector with the label 'app: wordpress'. Inside the template, I defined the WordPress container with the image 'wordpress:latest'."

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

Expert 1: "To ensure external access to the WordPress website, we need a Service manifest for the WordPress container. I named it 'wordpress-service' and selected the Pod with the label 'app: wordpress'. I exposed and targeted port 80 for the WordPress service."

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: wordpress-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: wordpress-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Expert 2: "For external network routing, I'm creating an Ingress manifest named 'wordpress-ingress'. I defined a rule for the host 'example.com' and configured routing to the 'wordpress-service' on port 80. This ensures traffic is directed to the WordPress container."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Expert 3: "Considering the need for persistent storage for the MySQL database, I've crafted a PersistentVolumeClaim manifest named 'mysql-pvc'. It requests 1Gi of storage with ReadWriteOnce access mode. This ensures data persistence for the database."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Expert 1: "We also require persistent storage for the WordPress container. I've created a PersistentVolumeClaim manifest named 'wordpress-pvc' with similar specifications to the MySQL PVC. Both containers will now have stable storage."

Now the collaborative effort of the experts has led to a complete set of Kubernetes YAML manifests for deploying a WordPress website using a MySQL database as the backend.
