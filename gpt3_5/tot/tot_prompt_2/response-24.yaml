```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mysql
    image: mysql
    env:
      - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        value: password
---
```

Expert 1: "I've started by creating a Pod manifest for the MySQL database named 'mysql'. I've added a container with the MySQL image and set the MySQL root password as an environment variable."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
---
```

Expert 2: "I see the MySQL Pod is missing a network Service for external access. Let's create a Service named 'mysql' to route traffic to the MySQL Pod."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql
        env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            value: password
---
```

Expert 3: "I've transformed the MySQL Pod to a Deployment for better scalability. The template now includes a selector, ensuring multiple replicas can be managed. Let's move on to integrating WordPress."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
  WORDPRESS_DB_USER: root
  WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: password
---
```

Expert 1: "Let's create a ConfigMap named 'wordpress-config' to store WordPress configuration, including MySQL connection details."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
---
```

Expert 2: "Now let's create a Service named 'wordpress' for external access to the WordPress Pod. I've set the port 80 and defined it as NodePort for easy access."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress
        envFrom:
          - configMapRef:
              name: wordpress-config
---
```

Expert 3: "I've created a WordPress Deployment, integrating the ConfigMap 'wordpress-config' for WordPress configuration. This setup ensures WordPress can communicate with the MySQL database securely."

This sequence of YAML manifests deploys a WordPress website using a MySQL database as the backend. Each expert contributed valuable insights, leading to a comprehensive and functional Kubernetes setup.
