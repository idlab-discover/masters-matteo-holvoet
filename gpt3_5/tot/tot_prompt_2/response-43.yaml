I would start by defining a Pod manifest for deploying both WordPress and MySQL containers together. I'll name the Pod "wordpress-mysql-pod" as it will host both containers. For the MySQL container, I will use the official MySQL image and set the required environment variables MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD and MYSQL_DATABASE. For the WordPress container, I will use the official WordPress image and set the environment variables WORDPRESS_DB_HOST (pointing to the MySQL container within the Pod), WORDPRESS_DB_NAME, and WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress-mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress-mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:

          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: password
            - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
              value: wordpress
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
              value: wordpress
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
              value: password
```

Expanding on the previous Pod setup, we can now separate concerns by creating a Service to expose the WordPress website and MySQL database internally in the cluster. I will name the Service "wordpress-mysql-service" and define a selector to associate it with the "wordpress-mysql" Pod. For the Deployment, I'll create a replica set of 1 for our Pod. I'll also update the labels and selectors to match this new setup. This way, we can easily scale the deployment if needed.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress-mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress-mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress-mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: password
            - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
              value: wordpress
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql-service
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
              value: wordpress
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
              value: password
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress-mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```

Taking inspiration from previous explanations, I am refining the Service setup to provide better connectivity. I'm updating the WordPress container's environment variable WORDPRESS_DB_HOST to use the Service name "mysql-service" instead of directly referencing the container name. This change allows easier service discovery within the Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, I'm introducing a new separate Service named "mysql-service" for the MySQL container to expose the MySQL database port 3306 within the cluster.

This collective effort results in a comprehensive Kubernetes setup for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend.
