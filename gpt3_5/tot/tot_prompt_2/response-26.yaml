```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mysql
    image: mysql:latest
```

Expert 1: I believe the first step is to deploy a MySQL Pod. I have created a basic YAML manifest for the MySQL container with the image set to 'mysql:latest'.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

Expert 2: Ah, we also need a Service to expose the MySQL container to other Pods. I've created the MySQL Service manifest with the selector set to 'app: mysql' and the port set to 3306.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
```

Expert 3: Let's enhance our deployment by using a Deployment instead of a Pod directly. I have updated the YAML manifest to deploy the MySQL container using a Deployment strategy with one replica.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  containers:
  - name: wordpress
    image: wordpress:latest
```

Expert 1: Now it's time to create the WordPress Pod. I've prepared a basic YAML manifest for the WordPress container with the image set to 'wordpress:latest'.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

Expert 2: Let's also create a Service for the WordPress container to expose it. I've crafted the WordPress Service manifest with the appropriate selector and ports set.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
```

Expert 3: We should use a Deployment for the WordPress container as well. I've refined the YAML manifest to deploy the WordPress container using a Deployment strategy with one replica.

This concludes our collaboration in creating Kubernetes YAML manifests to deploy a WordPress website using a MySQL database as the backend. Thank you for the teamwork, everyone!
