```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql:latest
      env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password
    - name: wordpress
      image: wordpress:latest
```
Expert 1: "I started by defining a Pod manifest with two containers: one for the MySQL database and one for the WordPress application. I set the image for MySQL to 'mysql:latest' and provided the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable with the value 'password'. For the WordPress container, I set the image to 'wordpress:latest'. Let's see what the other experts have to say."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress-mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress-mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: password
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
```
Expert 2: "I refined the approach by creating a Deployment instead of a Pod. This allows for easier management, scaling, and self-healing capabilities. The Deployment manages a ReplicaSet with one replica and correlates to the Pod. I made sure to match the labels in the selector and template sections. I've also specified the container names as 'mysql' and 'wordpress' respectively, along with their images and the MySQL root password. Let's see if the final expert can further enhance this manifest."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress-mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress-mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: password
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress-mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```
Expert 3: "I've built upon the previous Deployment manifest by adding a Service definition to expose the WordPress website. The Service selects the Pods with the label 'app: wordpress-mysql' and exposes a port 80 to access the website. This will allow external access to the WordPress application. Together with the Deployment, we now have a complete solution for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend in Kubernetes."
