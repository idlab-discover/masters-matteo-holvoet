```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mysql
    image: mysql
```

The first expert starts by creating a YAML manifest for a Pod to deploy the MySQL database container. They have named the Pod "mysql-pod" and the MySQL container "mysql". This is a good starting point, but we can further enhance this by considering using Deployments for better management and scalability.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql
```

The second expert builds upon the previous explanation and suggests using a Deployment instead of a Pod for managing the MySQL container. The Deployment is named "mysql-deployment" and ensures high availability by setting the replicas to 1. The template section is used to define the Pod template with the MySQL container named "mysql". This is a great improvement, but we should now proceed to create the WordPress deployment and service.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress
```

The third expert jumps in and proposes a Deployment for the WordPress container. The Deployment is named "wordpress-deployment" with the WordPress container named "wordpress". By setting the replicas to 1, we ensure that there is a single instance of the WordPress container running. To make these services accessible, we need to create a Service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

After the insightful input from the third expert, a service named "wordpress-service" is created to expose the WordPress deployment to the outside world. The service selects the pods with the label "app: wordpress" and routes the traffic from port 80 to the WordPress container's port 80. This completes the setup for deploying a WordPress website using a MySQL database backend.
