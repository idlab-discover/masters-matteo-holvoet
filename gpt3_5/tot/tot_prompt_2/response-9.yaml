```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: wordpress
    image: wordpress:latest
  - name: mysql
    image: mysql:latest
```

Expert 1: "I believe we can start with a Pod manifest to deploy both WordPress and MySQL containers. Let's keep it simple for now by specifying the container names and their images."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress-mysql
  ports:
    - name: mysql
      port: 3306
  - name: wordpress
      port: 80
```

Expert 2: "We need a Service to expose these containers internally within the cluster. Let's correct the formatting and ensure the ports are correctly assigned to each container."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress-mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress-mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
```

Expert 3: "I think we should switch to a Deployment manifest instead of a Pod to ensure resiliency and easier management. Let's add the replica count and matchLabels. Also, corrected the container indentation."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress-mysql
  ports:
    - name: wordpress
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress-mysql
  ports:
    - name: mysql
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

Expert 1: "To better manage and scale the services independently, it's a good idea to create separate Services for WordPress and MySQL. Let's define a Service for each container with the appropriate port mappings."
