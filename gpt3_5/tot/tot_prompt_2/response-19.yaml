```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: wordpress-namespace
```

Expert 1: "Let's start by creating a Namespace for our WordPress deployment to keep our resources organized and isolated from other workloads."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
  namespace: wordpress-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: root_password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
```

Expert 2: "Let's move on and create a Deployment for the MySQL database. We label it as 'mysql' for easy identification and set the image to use MySQL version 5.7. We also specify the root password and expose port 3306 for connections."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
  namespace: wordpress-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

Expert 3: "Next, let's create a Service for the MySQL Deployment to allow communication between the MySQL container and other resources within the namespace."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
  namespace: wordpress-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
            value: mysql-service
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
            value: root_password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Expert 1: "Now, let's create a Deployment for the WordPress website. We set the image to use the latest WordPress version and configure the environment variables to point to the MySQL Service we created earlier, as well as set the database password."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
  namespace: wordpress-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

Expert 2: "To enable external access to the WordPress website, we create a Service for the WordPress Deployment, exposing port 80 to route traffic to the WordPress container."

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: wordpress-ingress
  namespace: wordpress-namespace
spec:
  rules:
  - host: wordpress.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: wordpress-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

Expert 3: "Finally, to expose the WordPress site to the outside world, we create an Ingress resource with a rule to route traffic from 'wordpress.example.com' to our WordPress Service."

This completes the collaborative effort to deploy a WordPress website using a MySQL database as the backend in Kubernetes, with each expert contributing their insights and refining the overall solution step by step.
