Expert 1: "To deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL backend, we first need to create PersistentVolumes for MySQL and WordPress using hostPath for simplicity. Let's name them mysql-pv and wordpress-pv respectively."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Expert 2: "We should now create PersistentVolumeClaims for the MySQL and WordPress deployments to claim storage from the PersistentVolumes we defined earlier. Let's name them mysql-pvc and wordpress-pvc with a storage request of 1Gi each."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: password
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3306

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
              value: password
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

Expert 3: "Next, we need to define the Deployments for MySQL and WordPress. For the MySQL deployment, we use the official MySQL image with a root password. For WordPress, we use the official WordPress image and set the environment variables to connect to the MySQL database. Let's name the containers 'mysql' and 'wordpress' respectively."

This is the final setup for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend in Kubernetes.
