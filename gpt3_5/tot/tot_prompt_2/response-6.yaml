```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql
      env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password
```

Expert 1: "Let's start by creating a Pod manifest for MySQL. We need to ensure that the container is named 'mysql' and set up the MySQL root password. The image should be 'mysql'."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: wordpress
      image: wordpress
      env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql-service
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: password
```

Expert 2: "Now, we should create a Pod manifest for WordPress. The container should be named 'wordpress', use the 'wordpress' image, and set environment variables for the database host and password. Let's link it to the MySQL Pod by setting the 'WORDPRESS_DB_HOST' to the MySQL service name 'mysql-service'."

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

Expert 3: "Instead of directly connecting Pods, let's use a Kubernetes Service to abstract the MySQL Pod. We name the service 'mysql-service', select the MySQL Pod with the label 'app: mysql', and define the target port as 3306."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: password
```

Expert 1: "To ensure scalability and manageability, let's create a Deployment for MySQL. This allows us to easily scale the number of replicas in the future if needed. We set the replica to 1, define the selector with the label 'app: mysql', and specify the MySQL container details."

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql-service
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
              value: password
```

Expert 2: "Similarly, we should create a Deployment for the WordPress container. This allows us to manage scalability and upgrades easily. We set the replica to 1, define the selector with the label 'app: wordpress', and specify the WordPress container details, including the environment variables for the database connection."

By collaborating and building upon each other's insights, we have successfully created Kubernetes YAML manifests to deploy a WordPress website using a MySQL database as the backend.
