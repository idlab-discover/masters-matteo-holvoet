Expert 1 - Kubernetes Developer

Step 1: Create a PersistentVolume for MySQL database storage.
Thinking: To ensure that the data in the MySQL database persists even if the container fails, we need to create a PersistentVolume where the data will be stored.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  nfs:
    path: /path/to/nfs
    server: my-nfs-server
```

Expert 2 - DevOps Engineer

Step 1: Create a PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL to claim the PersistentVolume created by the Kubernetes Developer.
Thinking: We need to ensure MySQL can claim the storage space defined by the PersistentVolume for data persistence.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

Expert 3 - Kubernetes Administrator

Step 1: Create a Service for MySQL to expose it within the cluster.
Thinking: MySQL needs a Service to enable other pods to access it within the Kubernetes cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

After reviewing the responses from all three experts, it seems that all steps provided are essential for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend on Kubernetes. The approach covers the necessary components such as PersistentVolume, PersistentVolumeClaim, and Service for MySQL. Each expert's steps are complementary and collectively form a complete deployment solution.
