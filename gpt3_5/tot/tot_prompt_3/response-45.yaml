Step 1: Create a PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL data.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```
Thinking: To deploy a MySQL database as the backend, we need to ensure data persistence. Creating a PersistentVolumeClaim will allow MySQL data to persist beyond the container lifecycle.

Expert 2: **Kubernetes Administrator**
Step 1: Create a Service for MySQL for internal cluster communication.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```
Thinking: Creating a Service for MySQL will allow other components within the cluster to communicate with the MySQL database. This helps in decoupling the database functionality from the application functionality.

Expert 3: **DevOps Engineer**
Step 1: Create a Deployment for MySQL to ensure fault tolerance.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: password
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3306
```
Thinking: Deploying MySQL as a Deployment ensures that there is always at least one instance running for fault tolerance. The provided manifest will create a single MySQL container running in the cluster.
