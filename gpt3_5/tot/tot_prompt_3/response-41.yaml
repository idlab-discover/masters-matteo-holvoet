Expert 1 (Deployment Expert):

Step 1: Create a Deployment for MySQL:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: example
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
```
Thinking: I have created a Deployment manifest for MySQL with a single replica using the `mysql:5.7` image. I set the root password environment variable and exposed port 3306.

Expert 2 (Service Expert):

Step 2: Create a Service for MySQL:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```
Thinking: I have created a Service manifest named `mysql-service` that exposes port 3306 and targets the `app: mysql` selector.

Expert 3 (Deployment Expert):

Step 3: Create a Deployment for WordPress:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql-service
          # Using the service name to connect to the MySQL backend
```
Thinking: I have created a Deployment manifest for WordPress with a single replica using the `wordpress:latest` image. I exposed port 80 and set the environment variable `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST` to the `mysql-service` name to connect to the MySQL backend.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```
Thinking: I have created a Service manifest named `wordpress-service` that exposes port 80 and targets the `app: wordpress` selector.

Final Analysis: The provided manifests by all three experts seem to be correctly structured and aligned with the requirements to deploy a WordPress website using a MySQL database backend in Kubernetes. The services are correctly pointing to the respective selectors, and the necessary environment variables are set. Thus, the provided solution appears to be valid.

Consensus Solution: The manifests from all experts are accurate, and the solution is correct for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend in Kubernetes.
