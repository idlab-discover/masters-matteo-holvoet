Expert 1: Kubernetes Administrator

Step 1: I would start by defining the necessary Kubernetes resources, such as Deployment or StatefulSet for both WordPress and MySQL, and also a Service for each to enable communication within the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```
