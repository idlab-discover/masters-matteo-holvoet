Step 1: Create a Deployment for MySQL:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password
```

Thinking: Creating a Deployment for MySQL with the specified image and setting the root password as "password" for simplicity. This will ensure a single instance of MySQL runs in the cluster.

Step 2: Create a Service for MySQL:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

Thinking: Defining a Service to allow communication with the MySQL Deployment using port 3306.

Step 3: Create a Deployment for WordPress:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql:3306
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: password
```

Thinking: Defining a Deployment for WordPress with necessary environment variables to connect to the MySQL instance. The DB_HOST is set to `mysql:3306`, targeting the MySQL Service.
