Expert 1 (DevOps Engineer):
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql
spec:
  containers:
    - name: wordpress
      image: wordpress:latest
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql:latest
```

Expert 2 (Kubernetes Developer):
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress-mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress-mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
```

Expert 3 (Cloud Architect):
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress-mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress-mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress-mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
```

Explanations and Scoring:
- Expert 1 provided a simple Pod manifest which does not fulfill the requirements of having a separate MySQL container and naming the containers.
- Expert 2 used a Deployment manifest correctly but still missed the requirement of naming the containers.
- Expert 3 created a Service manifest in addition to the Deployment, but the Service is not necessary for this specific question and the Deployment is missing container names.

I will now analyze the responses to provide the final solution.
