Expert 1 (Kubernetes Developer):

Step 1: I will start by creating a PersistentVolume for MySQL storage.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: local-storage
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data
```

I have created a PersistentVolume named "mysql-pv" with a capacity of 5Gi, ReadWriteOnce access mode, and using local storage at "/mnt/data". This will be the data storage for the MySQL database. Now, I will wait for the feedback from the other experts.

Expert 2 (Kubernetes Administrator):

Step 1: Sounds good. I will create a PersistentVolumeClaim for the MySQL Pod to claim the storage.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

I have created a PersistentVolumeClaim named "mysql-pvc" with a request for 5Gi storage using ReadWriteOnce access mode. This PVC will be used by the MySQL Pod to claim storage. Now, I'll share this with the group and move to the next step.

Expert 3 (Kubernetes Architect):

Step 1: Before deploying the MySQL, let's create a Secret for MySQL root password.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  root-password: BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD
```

I have created a Secret named "mysql-secret" with an encoded root password. This secret will be mounted into the MySQL Pod to provide the root password securely. Now, I'll share this with the group for their feedback.

I have provided the necessary YAML manifests for the initial setup of the MySQL backend part of the deployment. Now, I will wait for the feedback and move on to the next steps.
