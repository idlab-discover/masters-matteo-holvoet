```yaml
# Expert 1

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: wordpress
      image: wordpress:latest
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql:latest

# Thinking:
- This YAML manifest defines a Pod named "wordpress-mysql-pod" with two containers: "wordpress" with the WordPress image and "mysql" with the MySQL image. This pod will deploy the WordPress website with MySQL database as the backend.
```

```yaml
# Expert 2

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: wordpress
      image: wordpress:latest
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql:latest

# Thinking:
- I agree with Expert 1. The provided YAML manifest correctly defines a Pod for deploying WordPress with MySQL as the backend.
```
