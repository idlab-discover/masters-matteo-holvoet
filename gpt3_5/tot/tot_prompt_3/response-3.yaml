Expert 1 (Kubernetes Specialist):

Step 1: Create a Deployment for the MySQL container. Use the official MySQL Docker image, set the container name to "mysql", and configure environment variables for the database credentials.
Thinking: MySQL will be crucial for the WordPress site to function properly, and a Deployment ensures the container is always running in the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: password
            - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
              value: wordpress
---
```

Expert 2 (DevOps Engineer):

Step 2: Create a Service for the MySQL container to allow communication within the cluster. Use the ClusterIP type for internal communication and expose port 3306.
Thinking: A Service is needed to abstract the MySQL container's dynamic IP address and provide a stable DNS name for WordPress to connect to.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

Expert 3 (Sysadmin):

Step 3: Create a Deployment for the WordPress container. Use the official WordPress Docker image, set the container name to "wordpress", and configure environment variables for the database connection details.
Thinking: WordPress needs to be deployed to serve the website content, and it must connect to the MySQL database to function correctly.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql-service
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
              value: wordpress
