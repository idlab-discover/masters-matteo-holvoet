Step 1: Write the YAML manifest for the MySQL Deployment
Thinking: We need to define a Deployment for MySQL first. This Deployment will ensure that MySQL pods are running and can be managed easily.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            value: password
```

Step 2: Write the YAML manifest for the WordPress Deployment
Thinking: Once the MySQL Deployment is created, we can move on to defining the Deployment for WordPress. This Deployment will run the WordPress application and connect to the MySQL database.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
            value: mysql
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
            value: password
```

Step 3: Write the YAML manifest for Services (MySQL and WordPress)
Thinking: We need to define Services to expose the MySQL and WordPress Deployments internally within the Kubernetes cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```
