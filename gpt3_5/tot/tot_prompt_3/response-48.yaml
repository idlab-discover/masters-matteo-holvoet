#### Expert 1 - Kubernetes Specialist

Step:
1. Create a Deployment for MySQL.
Thinking: To deploy MySQL as a backend, a Deployment resource should be used to ensure availability and manageability.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password
```

#### Expert 2 - Cloud Architect

Step:
1. Create a PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL to ensure data persistence.
Thinking: MySQL requires data persistence, so a PersistentVolumeClaim should be used to provide storage for the database.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

#### Expert 3 - DevOps Engineer

Step:
1. Create a Service to expose MySQL to the WordPress container.
Thinking: The MySQL database needs to be accessible by the WordPress container, so a Service resource should be created to enable communication between them.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql-service
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: password
```
