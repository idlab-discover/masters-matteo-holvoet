Expert 1:

Step 1: Create a PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL storage.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

Thinking: We need to ensure that the MySQL database has persistent storage. By creating a PersistentVolumeClaim, we can request storage which will be used by the MySQL container.

Expert 2:

Step 1: Create a Deployment for MySQL.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: password
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3306
          volumeMounts:
            - name: mysql-pvc
              mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
        - name: mysql-pvc
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pvc
```

Thinking: I have created a Deployment for MySQL, ensuring that it has one replica and defining the necessary container configuration including the image, environment variables, ports, and volume mounts.

Expert 3:

Step 1: Create a Service for MySQL to allow communication within the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

Thinking: By creating a Service for MySQL, we can enable other components in the Kubernetes cluster to communicate with the MySQL database container using the defined port.

Expert 1: I will give Expert 2 a score of 4 as the Deployment for MySQL looks well-configured. Expert 3 also receives a score of 4 for creating the necessary Service.

Expert 2: I will give Expert 1 a score of 4 for setting up the PersistentVolumeClaim correctly. Expert 3 receives a score of 4 for creating the Service.

Expert 3: I will give Expert 1 a score of 4 for setting up the PersistentVolumeClaim. Expert 2 receives a score of 4 for creating the MySQL Deployment.

In conclusion, all experts provided accurate and necessary components for deploying MySQL in Kubernetes. Now let's proceed to the next step.
