Step 1: Create a PersistentVolume for MySQL to store its data.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data
```

I suggest creating a PersistentVolume for MySQL to ensure the data persistence for the MySQL database. This volume will have a capacity of 5Gi and will be mounted on the host's path /mnt/data.

Score for Expert 1:
This step seems appropriate for setting up a PersistentVolume for MySQL. MySQL would require a PersistentVolume to store its data in a production environment. I would give this a score of 5.

Expert 3 - Cloud Architect
Score for Expert 1:
Setting up a PersistentVolume for MySQL is a fundamental step when deploying a database on Kubernetes for data persistence. The configuration provided seems correct. I would give this a score of 5.

Next step: Creation of a PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL for dynamic provisioning.
