Step: Create a Deployment for MySQL
Thinking: To deploy MySQL as a backend database, a Deployment resource is suitable as it provides fault tolerance and scalability by managing replica sets.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password
```

Expert 2 - DevOps Engineer
Step: Create a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL
Thinking: MySQL requires persistent storage to store data. By creating a PersistentVolume and matching PersistentVolumeClaim, we ensure that the data is retained even if the MySQL pod is rescheduled.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Expert 3 - Cloud Architect
Step: Create a Service for MySQL to allow access within the cluster
Thinking: To access the MySQL database within the cluster, a Kubernetes Service of type ClusterIP should be created to provide a stable endpoint for other pods to connect to.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```
