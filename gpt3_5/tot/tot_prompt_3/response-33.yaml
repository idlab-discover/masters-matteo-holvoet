Expert 1 (DevOps Specialist):
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: wordpress
      image: wordpress
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql
```

Step: This YAML manifest is for a Pod instead of two separate Deployments for WordPress and MySQL, as requested. The containers need to be in separate deployments. The naming conventions are correct.

      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql
```

Step: This response includes Services for both WordPress and MySQL along with their respective Deployments. Each container is in a separate Deployment, meeting the requirements. It also considers the ports required by WordPress and MySQL services, which is an essential aspect of the deployment.
