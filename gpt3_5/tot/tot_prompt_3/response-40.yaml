Expert 1 - Kubernetes Developer:
Step 1: I will define a PersistentVolume for MySQL to store its data. This will ensure that the data is not lost even if the pod is restarted.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /data/mysql
```

Expert 2 - DevOps Engineer:
Step 1: I will create a PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL to claim the PersistentVolume we just defined, ensuring MySQL has persistent storage.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Expert 3 - Kubernetes Administrator:
Step 1: I will create Deployments for both MySQL and WordPress to ensure that the application is always running and can be easily scaled if needed.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: password
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
              name: mysql-persistent-storage

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
              value: password
```
