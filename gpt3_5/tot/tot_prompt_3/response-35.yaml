Step 1: Create a Deployment for the MySQL container
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password123
```

My thinking: In this step, we need to create a Deployment for the MySQL container with the appropriate image and environment variables.

spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password123
```

My thinking: I'm creating a Deployment for the MySQL container with the image version 5.7 as it's a stable version for WordPress compatibility.

Step 1: Create a Deployment for the MySQL container
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql

    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: password123
```

My thinking: The MySQL container should use version 5.7 for compatibility reasons with WordPress. Setting the root password as password123.
