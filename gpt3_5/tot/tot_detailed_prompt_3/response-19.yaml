Expert 1: Kubernetes Developer
Step 1: Create a ConfigMap for WordPress containing the database configuration.
YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  DB_NAME: wordpress
  DB_USER: wordpress
  DB_PASSWORD: password
  DB_HOST: mysql
```
Thinking: To provide the necessary database configuration for the WordPress container, we create a ConfigMap with the required key-value pairs for DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_HOST.

Expert 1: 5

Step 2: Define a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim for the MySQL data storage.
YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data/mysql

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```
Thinking: To ensure data persistence for the MySQL container, we need to define a PersistentVolume that will be claimed by the PersistentVolumeClaim. This will allow MySQL data to persist even if the container is restarted or rescheduled.

Step 3: Create Deployments for both WordPress and MySQL using the appropriate container images, ports, and environment variables.
YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: wordpress-config

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3306
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-secret
                  key: password
          volumeMounts:
            - name: mysql-persistent-storage
              mountPath: /var/lib/mysql

      volumes:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pvc
```
Thinking: Deployments are created for both WordPress and MySQL containers with the necessary specifications such as container images, ports, environment variables, and volume mounts for MySQL data persistence.

Scoring:
Expert 1: 5
