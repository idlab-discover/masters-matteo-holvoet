Step 1: Write a Deployment manifest for WordPress
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
```

Step 2: Write a Deployment manifest for MySQL
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
      volumeMounts:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
  volumes:
  - name: mysql-persistent-storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

Step 3: Write a Service manifest for WordPress
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

Step 4: Write a Service manifest for MySQL
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

Step 5: Implement ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration and sensitive data. (Not provided in this draft)

I'll now score my response a 4 since I have covered the main components required for deploying WordPress with MySQL in Kubernetes, but I didn't include the ConfigMaps and Secrets aspect.

*No response provided, expert leaves.*

Expert 3 - Kubernetes Administrator

Step 1: *No response provided, expert leaves.*

As expert 2 and expert 3 did not provide their responses, we have only the analysis of expert 1 to consider. Based on that, the provided YAML manifests cover most of the requirements but lack the implementation of ConfigMaps and Secrets. Therefore, the solution is not fully complete for the given requirements.
