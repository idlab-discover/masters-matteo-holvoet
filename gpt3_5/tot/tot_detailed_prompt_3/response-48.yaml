Step 1: I will start by creating ConfigMaps and Secrets for the configuration and sensitive data. These will be used in the deployments for WordPress and MySQL containers.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
  WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: <base64-encoded-password>
```

Score for Expert 1 - Step 1: 4
The use of ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration and sensitive data is a good practice, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed in the manifest.

Step 2: Next, I will create a Deployment for the MySQL container, configuring it with PersistentVolumeClaims for data persistence.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

Utilizing a Deployment for the MySQL container with PersistentVolumeClaims for data persistence is a crucial step in ensuring data integrity and availability.

Step 3: Now, I will create a Deployment for WordPress with the appropriate container images, ports, and environment variables for database configuration.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        emptyDir: {}
```

Score for Expert 3 - Step 3: 4
Creating a Deployment for WordPress with the appropriate container images and environment variables is a good step. However, utilizing a PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence would be a better practice for production environments.

Considering the scores, the consensus solution would involve incorporating PersistentVolumeClaims for data persistence in the WordPress Deployment as well and setting up Services for both WordPress and MySQL to enable connectivity.
