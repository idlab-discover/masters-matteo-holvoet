Expert 1:

Step 1:
- Create a Deployment manifest for WordPress container named "wordpress" with the appropriate container image, ports, and environment variables for the database configuration.
Thinking: WordPress needs to connect to the MySQL database, so I will define the necessary environment variables to set the database host, password, and user.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql-service
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: password
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: user
```

Step 2:
- Rate the response between 1 and 5.
- My rating: 4

Step 3: Share the deployment manifest with the group.

Step 1:
- Create a Deployment manifest for MySQL container named "mysql" configured with PersistentVolumeClaims for data persistence.
Thinking: MySQL needs persistent storage for data persistence. I will define PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim in the Deployment manifest.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-persistent-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Step 2:
- Rate the response between 1 and 5.
- My rating: 5

Step 3: Share the deployment manifest with the group.

Expert 3:

Step 1:
- Create Service manifests for both WordPress and MySQL to enable connectivity.
Thinking: Services are needed to expose the WordPress and MySQL Deployments within the cluster. I will define ClusterIP type Services for both WordPress and MySQL.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

Step 2:
- Rate the response between 1 and 5.
- My rating: 4

Step 3: Share the service manifests with the group.
