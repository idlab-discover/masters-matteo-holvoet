### Expert 1: Kubernetes Specialist

**Step 1: Create Deployment for WordPress**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:

        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress

```

**Step 2: Create Deployment for MySQL with PersistentVolumeClaims**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc

```

Please review and provide feedback.

### Expert 2: DevOps Engineer

**Step 1: Create Services for WordPress and MySQL**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
---
```

**Step 2: Use ConfigMaps and Secrets for Configuration**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_CONFIG_FILE: wp-config.php

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: <base64_encoded_password>
---
```

Looking forward to your evaluation.

### Expert 3: Cloud Architect

**Step 1: Overall Manifest Integration**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: wordpress-mysql

---

# Include the Deployments for WordPress and MySQL from the previous steps

---

# Include the Services for WordPress and MySQL from the previous steps

---

# Include ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration and sensitive data from the previous steps
```

**Step 2: Check Resource Requests and Limits**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress-deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "64Mi"
              cpu: "250m"
            limits:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
---
```

Awaiting feedback on the proposed solution and any potential improvements. Thank you.

### Evaluation and Consensus Solution

- Expert 1: The provided Deployment manifests for WordPress and MySQL containers seem correct, including the configuration to connect WordPress to MySQL. The use of volume mounts for MySQL data is appropriate. The expert receives a score of 4.
- Expert 2: The creation of Services for WordPress and MySQL is correct, enabling connectivity to the pods. However, the ConfigMaps and Secrets should include relevant configuration and sensitive data, rather than just placeholders. The expert receives a score of 3.
- Expert 3: The integration into a common namespace is a good practice for organization. However, the deployment of resources without defining resource requests and limits may not be optimal for production use. The expert receives a score of 3.

Based on the analysis, the consensus solution would be a combination of the correct steps from each expert, ensuring complete deployment, configuration, and resource management for a WordPress website with a MySQL backend in a Kubernetes environment.
