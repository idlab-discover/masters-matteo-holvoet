Step:
1. I will first create a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim for the MySQL data storage.
Thinking:
This step is crucial for ensuring that the data in MySQL persists even if the container crashes or gets rescheduled. By providing a PersistentVolumeClaim, we can ensure that the storage is retained across Pod restarts.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/data/mysql"

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```
