1. I would start by defining the ConfigMap and Secrets for the configuration data. This will include environment variables with sensitive information for the database connection such as username, password, and database name.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  DB_HOST: mysql
  DB_NAME: wordpress
  DB_USER: my_db_user
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: <base64 encoded root password>
```

2. Next, I will move on to creating the PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL data persistence.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /data/mysql
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
```

Please score my responses between 1 and 5.
