Expert 1 (Step 1):
Step: Define the Deployment for WordPress with the necessary container images, ports, and environment variables for database configuration.
Thinking: For the WordPress Deployment, we need to specify the container image, ports, and environment variables to configure the database connection.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-secrets
                  key: username
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-secrets
                  key: password
```

Expert 2 (Step 2):
Step: Define the Deployment for MySQL with PersistentVolumeClaims for data persistence.
Thinking: The MySQL Deployment should include PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:latest
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-secrets
                  key: root_password
          volumeMounts:
            - name: mysql-persistent-storage
              mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pvc
```

Expert 3 (Step 3):
Step: Define Services for both WordPress and MySQL to enable connectivity.
Thinking: Services are needed to expose the WordPress and MySQL Deployments internally in the Kubernetes cluster.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

Final analysis:
Expert 1 and Expert 3 provided accurate steps for defining the necessary components for the WordPress Deployment, MySQL Deployment, and Services. Expert 2 had a slight mistake in the MySQL Deployment by missing the `volumes` key. Therefore, Expert 2 is eliminated from the group. The consensus solution aligns with the correct steps provided by Expert 1 and Expert 3. The relevant YAML manifests for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database in Kubernetes are as follows:
```yaml

        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-secrets

              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
