Absolutely. Let's start by defining the ConfigMaps and Secrets that we will need for our WordPress and MySQL deployments.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpress-config
data:
  WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: <base64-encoded-password>
```

Great start. Now, we can proceed to define the MySQL Deployment with PersistentVolumeClaims for data persistence.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-secret
              key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
```

Nice addition with the MySQL Deployment. Now, let's move on to defining the WordPress Deployment which will reference the ConfigMap for database configuration.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: wordpress-config
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Excellent work. We have the Deployments set up. Next, let's define the Services for WordPress and MySQL.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    app: wordpress
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
```

This is shaping up nicely. We have the Services defined. Lastly, let's add the PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL data persistence.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

Great teamwork everyone. We now have a complete Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend, including all the required components such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and PersistentVolumeClaims.
