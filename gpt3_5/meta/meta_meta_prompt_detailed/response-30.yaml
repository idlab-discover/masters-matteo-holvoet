# Helm Charts integration can be achieved by creating a Helm chart for the entire WordPress deployment and MySQL StatefulSet, managing them through Helm releases.
  
# Monitoring and Logging with Prometheus and Grafana can be implemented by deploying Prometheus Operator and Grafana using their respective Helm charts.

# Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators can be developed based on specific requirements related to WordPress or MySQL deployment.

# Canary deployment can be implemented using tools like Istio or Flagger to gradually release updates and assess their impact in a controlled manner.
