# Monitoring and Logging using Prometheus and Grafana
# Implementations depend on the specific monitoring/logging solutions chosen.
# Backup and Disaster Recovery strategies to be defined based on the storage backend used.
# Alternative database solutions like CockroachDB or Amazon Aurora could be considered.
# Security best practices including Network Policies and Pod Security Policies should be implemented.
# Service Mesh implementation using tools like Istio or Linkerd for improved service communication.
# Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) can be used for extending Kubernetes functionality as needed.
