5. Revised Prompt:
   "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend in a multi-cloud environment. Consider the following advanced requirements:
    - Implement an autoscaling mechanism for the WordPress Deployment based on CPU utilization.
    - Utilize HorizontalPodAutoscalers to dynamically adjust the number of MySQL instances based on traffic patterns.
    - Implement pod affinity and anti-affinity rules to optimize resource distribution and performance.
    - Explore the use of StatefulSets for MySQL to manage data consistency and availability.
    - Implement network policies to restrict communication between WordPress and MySQL to only essential ports.
    - Investigate the use of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for managing custom configurations.
    - Consider implementing PodDisruptionBudgets to ensure high availability during maintenance.
    - Evaluate the use of Service Mesh technologies for advanced traffic management between WordPress and MySQL.
    - Utilize Istio for implementing advanced security measures such as mutual TLS authentication."
6. This revised prompt aims to challenge participants to think critically about advanced Kubernetes concepts, explore complex scenarios, and encourage the integration of various technologies for a robust deployment architecture.
