5. [Revised Prompt]:
Create a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend. In addition to the specifications provided in the initial prompt, consider the following advanced challenges:
	- Implement a horizontal pod autoscaler to dynamically adjust the number of WordPress pods based on CPU utilization.
	- Utilize StatefulSets for MySQL deployment to maintain stable, unique network identities and persistent storage for each MySQL replica.
	- Implement Network Policies to restrict traffic between the WordPress and MySQL pods to only allow necessary communication.
	- Utilize Init Containers to perform any pre-requisite tasks before the main WordPress and MySQL containers start.
	- Explore the use of third-party Kubernetes tools or plugins to enhance the deployment process and efficiency.
	- Implement a rolling update strategy for both WordPress and MySQL deployments to ensure minimal downtime during updates.
	- Consider implementing Pod Disruption Budgets to ensure that a minimum number of pods are available during maintenance or other disruptions.
	
This revised prompt challenges you to think critically about advanced Kubernetes concepts and practices, pushing you to explore alternative solutions and optimize your deployment strategy. Good luck!
