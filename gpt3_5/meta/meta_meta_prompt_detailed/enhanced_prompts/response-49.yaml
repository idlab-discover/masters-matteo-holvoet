5. Revised Prompt:
    "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a highly secure and scalable WordPress deployment. Your manifest should incorporate advanced security measures, such as Network Policies and RBAC, to safeguard the infrastructure. Implement a multi-tier architecture with separate components for caching, load balancing, and a centralized logging system. Ensure efficient resource utilization by employing Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on custom metrics. Additionally, explore innovative deployment strategies like Canary Releases or Blue-Green Deployments to minimize downtime and ensure smooth updates. Consider leveraging advanced monitoring and alerting tools to maintain optimal performance. Lastly, implement infrastructure as code principles to enhance reproducibility and maintainability of your deployment."
