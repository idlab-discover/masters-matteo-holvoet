5. Revised Prompt:
   "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest that deploys a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend in a multi-cloud environment, optimizing for high availability and scalability. Consider implementing advanced networking configurations, such as Network Policies and Ingress controllers, to enhance security and performance.
      - Develop a deployment strategy that incorporates multiple pods for WordPress with automated scaling based on resource utilization metrics.
      - Implement advanced database replication techniques for MySQL to ensure data integrity and disaster recovery.
      - Utilize Horizontal Pod Autoscaling and Cluster AutoScaler to dynamically adjust resource allocation based on workload demands.
      - Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualization of cluster metrics and performance data.
      - Employ GitOps principles for managing configuration changes and updates across multiple environments.
      - Explore advanced strategies for secret management and encryption to secure sensitive data within the cluster.
      - Consider implementing a service mesh architecture for enhanced communication and observability between microservices within the cluster.
      
      The goal is to create a robust and resilient infrastructure that leverages cutting-edge technologies to optimize performance, scalability, and security for the WordPress and MySQL deployments."
