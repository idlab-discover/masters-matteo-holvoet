[Revised Prompt]
Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend in a highly secure and scalable environment. Consider the following challenges:
	- Implement a horizontally scalable architecture for both WordPress and MySQL to handle increased traffic efficiently.
	- Utilize StatefulSets for MySQL to manage database replication and failover in case of node failures.
	- Implement Network Policies to restrict network access between WordPress and MySQL containers for enhanced security.
	- Explore the use of Helm charts for managing complex deployments and configurations of WordPress and MySQL.
	- Implement Health Checks and Probes to ensure the reliability and availability of the WordPress and MySQL services.
	- Explore the use of Admission Controllers for enforcing custom policies and security measures at the Kubernetes API level.
	- Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automating the deployment and updates of the WordPress website and MySQL database.

This revised prompt challenges you to think beyond standard deployment practices and incorporate advanced concepts in Kubernetes to build a robust and efficient infrastructure for hosting a WordPress website with a MySQL backend.
