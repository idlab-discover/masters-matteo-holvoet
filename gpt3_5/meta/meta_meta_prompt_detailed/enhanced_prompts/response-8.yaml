[Revised Prompt]
Design a holistic Kubernetes architecture for a distributed application deployment encompassing a WordPress website and a MySQL database backend. Focus on achieving high availability, scalability, and security by considering the following:
- Implement a microservices architecture for modular and efficient resource utilization.
- Utilize Helm charts for streamlined deployment management and version control.
- Employ Kubernetes Operators for automated lifecycle management of the application components.
- Implement Network Policies to enforce strict communication rules between pods for enhanced security.
- Integrate Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
- Explore the use of custom controllers or operators for intelligent scaling and self-healing mechanisms.
- Leverage Kubernetes StatefulSets for managing the MySQL database with data durability and resilience in mind.
- Evaluate the use of Istio for traffic management and service mesh capabilities to enhance network security and observability.
- Employ advanced Kubernetes features such as PodDisruptionBudgets and PodAntiAffinity for fault tolerance and workload distribution.
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins or GitLab CI for automated testing and continuous delivery to Kubernetes clusters.
This revised prompt aims to challenge your thinking by exploring cutting-edge Kubernetes practices and solutions for deploying complex distributed applications.
