Revised Prompt:
"You are tasked with designing a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a highly scalable WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. The architecture must be fault-tolerant and capable of handling a high volume of traffic. Consider implementing automated scaling mechanisms and load balancing strategies to optimize performance. Additionally, explore innovative security measures beyond traditional ConfigMaps and Secrets to safeguard sensitive data. Your manifest should demonstrate a thorough understanding of cloud-native design principles and exemplify advanced container orchestration techniques. How would you approach this complex deployment scenario, considering all aspects of reliability, performance, and security?"
