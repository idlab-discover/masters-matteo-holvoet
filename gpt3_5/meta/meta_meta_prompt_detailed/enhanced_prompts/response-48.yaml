5. Revised Prompt:
    "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a multi-tier application consisting of a WordPress website and a MySQL database. Your task is to create a scalable and resilient architecture that includes the following components:
	    - Implement a horizontal pod autoscaler for the WordPress container to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
	    - Incorporate pod affinity and anti-affinity rules to optimize pod placement for both WordPress and MySQL deployments.
	    - Utilize StatefulSets for the MySQL deployment to ensure stable and ordered scaling.
	    - Implement network policies to restrict communication between the WordPress and MySQL containers for enhanced security.
	    - Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualization of resource usage and performance metrics.
	    - Employ a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment of updates to the application stack.
	    - Implement a disaster recovery plan using backup and restore mechanisms for both the WordPress website and MySQL database.
	    - Evaluate and propose efficient strategies for data backup and disaster recovery, considering both RTO and RPO metrics.
	    - Consider incorporating service mesh technologies like Istio for advanced traffic management and security capabilities.
