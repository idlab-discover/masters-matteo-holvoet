[Revised Prompt]
Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a scalable microservices architecture that includes multiple interconnected services. Ensure the manifest addresses the following challenges:
    - Implement a service mesh architecture using Istio to enhance service communication, security, and observability.
    - Utilize Helm charts for managing the deployment of microservices, enabling efficient version control and configuration management.
    - Implement horizontal pod autoscaling based on custom metrics to ensure optimal resource utilization and performance.
    - Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualization of key performance metrics across all services.
    - Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or GitLab CI to automate testing, deployment, and rollback processes.
    - Implement canary deployments for gradual rollout of new features, reducing risks and ensuring a smooth user experience.
    - Utilize advanced networking concepts such as service mesh routing, network policies, and ingress controllers to enhance security and traffic management.
    - Implement chaos engineering practices to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses in the system's resilience and fault tolerance.
  
By revising the prompt to include these elements, you will be challenged to think critically and reason through complex scenarios, allowing for a deeper understanding of Kubernetes and microservices architecture.
