5. Revised Prompt:
    "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website and a MySQL database while optimizing for high availability, scalability, and security. Consider implementing advanced strategies such as horizontal pod autoscaling, network policies, and pod disruption budgets to enhance resilience. Ensure the manifest includes:
	    - Custom resource definitions for managing complex configurations.
	    - Utilization of Istio for traffic management and security policies between WordPress and MySQL.
        - Implementation of Pod Security Policies to enforce security best practices.
	    - Advanced monitoring and logging solutions using Prometheus and Grafana.
	    - Integration of Helm charts for modular deployment and version control.
	Explore novel approaches to achieve efficient resource utilization, streamline deployment processes, and elevate the overall performance of the WordPress and MySQL deployments. Challenge traditional methodologies and embrace innovative solutions to cultivate a comprehensive and forward-thinking deployment strategy."
