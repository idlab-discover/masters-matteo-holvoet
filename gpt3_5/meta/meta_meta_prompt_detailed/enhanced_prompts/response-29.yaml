5. Revised Prompt:
    "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a scalable multi-tier architecture that includes a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. In your manifest, consider implementing the following advanced features:
        - Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for the WordPress Deployment based on CPU utilization.
        - Utilize StatefulSets for the MySQL Deployment to manage the database state effectively.
        - Configure Network Policies to restrict traffic between the WordPress and MySQL Pods.
        - Implement a Service Mesh like Istio for advanced traffic management and security between the services.
        - Explore using Operators or Helm charts for managing complex application deployments.
        - Employ GitOps practices for declarative and automated deployments.
        - Consider using custom Resource Definitions for extending Kubernetes functionality.
        - Utilize Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualization of cluster metrics.
        - Explore deploying the application across multiple Kubernetes clusters for high availability and disaster recovery scenarios.
        - Evaluate using Ingress Controllers for managing external access to the WordPress site.
        - Investigate using Helm Secrets or Sealed Secrets for managing sensitive data securely."
6. Revised Objective: To challenge participants to apply advanced Kubernetes concepts, design patterns, and best practices in a practical scenario. Encourage critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation in Kubernetes deployment strategies.
7. Expected Outcome: Participants will develop a deeper understanding of Kubernetes architecture, advanced features, and best practices. Enhance their ability to design and implement complex distributed systems effectively. Fosters creativity, exploration of emerging technologies, and encourages collaboration in designing resilient and scalable Kubernetes applications.
