Revised Prompt:
"You have been tasked with deploying a scalable and secure microservices architecture for a multi-tiered application that consists of WordPress for front-end web hosting and MySQL for backend database management on a Kubernetes cluster. Develop a robust YAML manifest that not only ensures the smooth deployment of the two components but also addresses the following advanced requirements:
    - Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for both WordPress and MySQL based on CPU utilization.
    - Utilize StatefulSets for MySQL pods to allow for ordered scaling and easy data management.
    - Enable network policies to restrict traffic flow between the WordPress and MySQL pods for enhanced security.
    - Implement custom metrics monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana for performance optimization.
    - Integrate CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment of changes to the Kubernetes environment.
    - Consider implementing a Service Mesh like Istio for advanced traffic management and security features.
Explore innovative solutions and consider different architectural approaches to optimize the deployment of the WordPress website and MySQL database on Kubernetes while emphasizing resilience, scalability, and security."
