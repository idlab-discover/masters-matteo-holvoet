5. [Revised Prompt]:
    "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a scalable, high-availability infrastructure to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend in a multi-cloud environment. Consider implementing the following advanced features:
	    - Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for both WordPress and MySQL deployments based on CPU utilization metrics.
	    - Utilize StatefulSets for MySQL to ensure ordered scaling and data persistence across multiple availability zones.
	    - Integrate Network Policies to enforce communication restrictions between WordPress and MySQL pods for enhanced security.
	    - Utilize Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to automate the creation of database schemas and user accounts upon deployment.
	    - Implement Canary Deployments for WordPress updates to gradually roll out changes and monitor performance impact.
	    - Explore the use of Istio for advanced traffic management and secure communication within the cluster.
	    - Implement Chaos Engineering practices to simulate failure scenarios and enhance system resilience.
	- Ensure to document your design considerations and rationale for each architectural decision made."
6. The revised prompt is designed to challenge participants to think critically about advanced Kubernetes concepts and design choices, fostering a deeper understanding of scalable infrastructure deployment. It encourages the exploration of innovative solutions and the incorporation of best practices to create a robust, high-performance system. Participants are prompted to analyze various aspects of the deployment process, from scalability and availability to security and automation, promoting a holistic approach to Kubernetes manifest design.
