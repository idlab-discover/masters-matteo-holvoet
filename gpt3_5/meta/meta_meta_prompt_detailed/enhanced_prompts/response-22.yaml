5. [Revised Prompt]:
Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a highly scalable and resilient architecture that deploys a WordPress website with multiple MySQL databases in a sharded configuration, catering to a global audience. Your manifest should encompass the following components:
- Utilize StatefulSets for MySQL instances to ensure data consistency and high availability.
- Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscalers for WordPress to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic patterns.
- Enable cross-region load balancing for enhanced performance and failover capabilities.
- Employ Pod Disruption Budgets to maintain service availability during maintenance or node failures.
- Implement Network Policies to restrict communication between pods to enhance security.
- Integrate Prometheus for monitoring performance metrics and Grafana for visualizing data trends.
- Utilize Kubernetes Secrets to securely store sensitive information such as database credentials and API keys.
- Implement custom resource definitions for advanced configuration management and resource allocation.
- Explore utilizing sidecar containers for additional functionality like caching or logging.
- Consider implementing advanced scheduling techniques such as node affinity and anti-affinity to optimize resource allocation.
- Emphasize the use of cloud-native technologies and best practices for optimal performance and scalability.
This revised prompt challenges you to think beyond traditional deployment strategies and encourages you to explore innovative solutions to complex problems in Kubernetes orchestration.
