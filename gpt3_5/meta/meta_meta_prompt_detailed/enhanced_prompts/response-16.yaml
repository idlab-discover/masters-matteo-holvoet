5. Revised Prompt:
"Design a robust and scalable Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend in a highly secure and fault-tolerant environment. Consider implementing advanced networking configurations, such as network policies and Ingress controllers, to enhance isolation and improve external access. Include strategies for automated backups and disaster recovery in case of data loss. Additionally, explore innovative approaches for horizontal scaling and load balancing to optimize performance under varying workloads. Your manifest should demonstrate a thorough understanding of Kubernetes best practices, including resource allocation, monitoring, and logging, while maintaining a focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Utilize advanced features such as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators, if applicable, to streamline management tasks and enhance overall system reliability."
