5. Revised Prompt:
    "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend, considering a scenario where the website experiences high traffic spikes. Your manifest should address the following challenges:
	    - Implement autoscaling mechanisms for both WordPress and MySQL based on resource utilization metrics.
	    - Utilize Helm charts for managing complex configurations and deployments.
	    - Implement a multi-tier architecture with load balancing using Ingress controllers.
	    - Integrate monitoring and logging solutions for performance optimization and troubleshooting.
	    - Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies for data protection.
	    - Explore alternative database solutions beyond MySQL that could better handle the scalability requirements of the WordPress website.
	    - Consider security best practices such as network policies and pod security policies to safeguard containerized applications.
	    - Evaluate the use of service meshes for improved service communication within the Kubernetes cluster.
	    - Investigate the use of custom resource definitions (CRDs) for extending Kubernetes functionality to meet specific requirements."
