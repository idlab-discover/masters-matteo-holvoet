[Revised Prompt]
Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest that deploys a WordPress website integrated with multiple microservices for advanced scalability and fault tolerance. The manifest must include the following components:
- Two WordPress containers named "wordpress-primary" and "wordpress-secondary" for load balancing and high availability.
- Implement a StatefulSet for MySQL to ensure data consistency and resilience, configured with automated backups and data encryption.
- Utilize horizontal pod autoscaling for both WordPress and MySQL to dynamically adjust resource allocation based on workload demands.
- Implement a Service Mesh architecture to enhance communication between microservices, utilizing Istio for traffic management and security policies.
- Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and metrics collection, enabling real-time performance analysis and proactive problem resolution.
- Employ GitOps principles for declarative configuration management, allowing for seamless updates and rollbacks across the deployment pipeline.
- Utilize Chaos Engineering practices to simulate failure scenarios and strengthen the overall system reliability and fault tolerance.

This revised prompt challenges you to think beyond traditional deployments and consider advanced concepts in cloud-native architecture, aiming to enhance your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding of complex Kubernetes environments.
