[Revised Prompt]
Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a cloud-native application that consists of multiple microservices interacting with each other. The application should include at least three microservices, each serving a distinct function such as user authentication, data processing, and image rendering. 
Ensure the manifest covers:
	- Implementing a scalable architecture using Deployments and Services for each microservice.
	- Utilizing Ingress for routing traffic efficiently between the microservices.
	- Implementing Health Checks and Load Balancing for robust application performance.
	- Employing Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to extend Kubernetes functionality for specific business logic.
	- Implementing Monitoring and Logging solutions to track the performance and health of the microservices.
	- Using Helm Charts for managing the deployment and versioning of the application.
Challenge participants to think critically about the interactions between microservices, scalability, fault tolerance, and security considerations. Encourage them to explore innovative solutions and consider best practices for cloud-native application development.
