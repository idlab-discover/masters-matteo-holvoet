5. Revised Input Prompt:
    "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend in a highly secure and scalable environment. Consider the following challenges:
	    - Implement a rolling deployment strategy for WordPress to minimize downtime during updates.
	    - Utilize StatefulSets for MySQL to ensure data integrity and high availability.
	    - Implement network policies to restrict access to sensitive data and enhance security.
	    - Explore the use of custom resource definitions for advanced configuration management.
	    - Consider the integration of monitoring and logging solutions for performance optimization.
	    - Investigate the use of service mesh technologies for enhanced network resilience.
	    - Evaluate the use of external authentication services for improved access control.
	    - Incorporate auto-scaling mechanisms for efficient resource utilization.
    This revised prompt challenges you to think critically about not just the implementation details, but also the broader implications of deploying a complex application like WordPress with MySQL in a Kubernetes environment."
