5. Revised Prompt:
    "Develop an advanced Kubernetes YAML manifest for a scalable web application architecture that includes a WordPress frontend and a MySQL backend. The manifest should encompass the following components:
	    - Define custom resources for autoscaling based on CPU utilization for both WordPress and MySQL.
	    - Implement a StatefulSet for MySQL with advanced configurations such as secure data encryption and automated backups.
	    - Utilize Service Mesh for traffic management and load balancing between the WordPress frontend and MySQL backend.
	    - Integrate Monitoring and Logging solutions for real-time performance metrics and error handling.
	    - Implement Infrastructure as Code principles for version-controlled infrastructure management.
	    - Explore innovative strategies for disaster recovery and high availability scenarios.
	    - Leverage CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and continuous deployment of updates.
	    - Evaluate the use of Service Mesh sidecar proxies for advanced routing and security enforcement.
	    - Incorporate best practices for networking, security, and resource optimization in a cloud-native environment.
	    - Experiment with advanced Kubernetes features like Pod Security Policies and Network Policies for enhanced security posture."
6. Final Note:
