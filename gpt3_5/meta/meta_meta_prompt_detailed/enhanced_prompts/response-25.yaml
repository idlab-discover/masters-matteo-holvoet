5. Revised Prompt:
   "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest that deploys a WordPress website and MySQL database with enhanced security measures. Consider implementing the following:
	    - Utilize Namespaces to segregate resources and restrict access based on roles and permissions.
	    - Implement Network Policies to control traffic flow between WordPress and MySQL containers.
	    - Integrate Service Accounts with limited privileges to enhance resource isolation.
	    - Utilize Pod Security Policies to enforce security controls such as limiting privileged access.
	    - Implement Cert-Manager for managing SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication.
	    - Explore potential use cases for implementing Istio for service mesh capabilities to enhance communication security and observability.
	    - Consider implementing GitOps practices for version-controlled, automated deployment and scaling of resources.
	    
     Your design should address not only the technical deployment aspects but also focus on security, scalability, and operational efficiency. Identify potential challenges and propose innovative solutions to address them."
