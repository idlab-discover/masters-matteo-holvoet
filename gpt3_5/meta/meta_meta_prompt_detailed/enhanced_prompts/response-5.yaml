Revised Prompt:
"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend in a high-security environment. Consider implementing advanced security measures such as Network Policies and Pod Security Policies.
Include the following components:
	- Name the WordPress container "wp-secure" and the MySQL container "mysql-secure" to reflect enhanced security measures.
	- Implement a multi-tier architecture with separate namespaces for WordPress and MySQL to isolate workloads.
	- Utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for fine-grained access control and limit privilege escalation.
	- Configure network policies to restrict traffic flow between the WordPress and MySQL containers, allowing only necessary communication.
	- Implement TLS encryption for communication between the WordPress frontend and MySQL backend for data protection.
	- Utilize Pod Security Policies to define security constraints and prevent unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
	- Incorporate advanced monitoring and logging solutions to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
	- Ensure compliance with industry standards such as CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks for a robust security posture.
Challenge conventional deployment practices and explore novel approaches to securing Kubernetes deployments effectively."
