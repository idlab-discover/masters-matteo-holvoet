5. Revised Prompt:
"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a multi-tiered application that includes a WordPress website front end, a MySQL database backend, and a Redis cache layer. Your manifest should:
    - Define separate Deployments for WordPress, MySQL, and Redis containers, each with their own unique configurations.
    - Implement a StatefulSet for MySQL to handle data persistence and automated backups.
    - Utilize Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for the WordPress frontend based on CPU utilization.
    - Create Services for each component to enable communication within the application.
    - Implement NetworkPolicies to restrict traffic between the different tiers of the application.
    - Utilize Ingress resources to provide external access to the WordPress site.
    - Implement a rolling update strategy for each Deployment using readiness probes to ensure zero downtime.
    - Utilize Prometheus monitoring and Grafana dashboards to track key performance metrics.
    - Secure sensitive data by storing credentials in Kubernetes Secrets and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for fine-grained access control.
    - Incorporate ConfigMaps for dynamic configuration of application settings.
    - Utilize PodDisruptionBudgets to ensure high availability during maintenance activities.
    - Leverage PodAntiAffinity rules to ensure high availability by preventing Pods from being scheduled on the same node.
    - Implement a comprehensive logging solution using Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana to centralize and analyze logs from all components.
    - Analyze and optimize resource utilization using ContainerResourceQuotas and LimitRanges.
