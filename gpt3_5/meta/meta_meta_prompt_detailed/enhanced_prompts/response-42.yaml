5. Revised Prompt:
    "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a highly scalable WordPress ecosystem that incorporates advanced deployment strategies. Consider utilizing multiple namespaces for isolation, implementing Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on resource metrics, and integrating Istio for advanced traffic management and security policies. Additionally, explore the use of Helm charts for templating and deploying complex application configurations. Your manifest should aim to optimize performance, resilience, and efficiency while addressing challenges related to microservices architecture and distributed systems. Embrace innovation and experimentation in your design to push the boundaries of traditional deployment practices."
