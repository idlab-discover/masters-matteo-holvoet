5. Revised Prompt:
    "Develop a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a scalable microservices architecture consisting of multiple interconnected services, each with its own specific configuration requirements. Design the architecture to include fault tolerance and high availability mechanisms, such as automated failover and load balancing. Incorporate advanced networking concepts, such as service mesh, to enable efficient communication between services. Implement security measures, such as network policies and RBAC, to ensure data protection and access control. Utilize advanced Kubernetes features, like StatefulSets and Custom Resource Definitions, to optimize resource management and deployment customization. Consider innovative approaches to handling stateful data, such as using external storage solutions or custom controllers. Experiment with advanced Kubernetes monitoring and logging techniques to gain insights into system performance and troubleshoot issues effectively. Emphasize the importance of continuous integration and deployment practices for seamless updates and rollbacks. Encourage the exploration of cutting-edge technologies, such as Istio or Prometheus, to enhance the overall architecture's resilience and scalability."
