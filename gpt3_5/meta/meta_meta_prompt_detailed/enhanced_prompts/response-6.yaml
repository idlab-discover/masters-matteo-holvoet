[Revised Prompt]
Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest that deploys a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend in a high-availability architecture. Consider the following:
	- Implement a horizontal autoscaling strategy for the WordPress Deployment based on incoming traffic metrics.
	- Utilize StatefulSets for managing the MySQL database to handle failover scenarios efficiently.
	- Configure network policies to restrict communication between the WordPress and MySQL containers for enhanced security.
	- Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments and updates of the application stack.
	- Explore the use of custom resource definitions (CRDs) for managing additional resources in the Kubernetes cluster.
	- Consider implementing Chaos Engineering principles to test the resilience of the application architecture under various failure scenarios.
	- Utilize Helm charts for templating and managing complex configurations across different environments.
	- Incorporate monitoring and logging solutions to gain insights into the performance and health of the application components.
	- Explore the use of service mesh technologies for enhancing communication between microservices within the architecture.
	- Experiment with different storage solutions such as distributed file systems or cloud-native storage options for data persistence.
	- Encourage the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices for managing the Kubernetes manifests in a version-controlled repository. 

This revised prompt challenges you to think beyond the basic setup and consider advanced strategies and technologies to design a robust and scalable application architecture. By exploring these complex elements, you will deepen your understanding of Kubernetes orchestration and cloud-native development practices.
