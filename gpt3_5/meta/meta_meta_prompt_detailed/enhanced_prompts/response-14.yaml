5. Revised Prompt:
"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable WordPress website with a highly available MySQL database backend for a global audience. Consider the following:
	- Implement a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for WordPress to dynamically adjust the number of replicas based on resource utilization.
	- Utilize StatefulSets for MySQL to ensure ordered deployment and scaling with persistent storage for data reliability.
	- Explore the use of Network Policies to restrict traffic between WordPress and MySQL pods for enhanced security.
	- Implement a robust backup and disaster recovery strategy for both WordPress and MySQL data.
	- Experiment with Pod Disruption Budgets to maintain availability during cluster maintenance or node failures.
	- Investigate advanced monitoring and logging solutions to optimize performance and troubleshoot issues proactively.
	- Emphasize the use of advanced Kubernetes features like Custom Resource Definitions to extend functionality beyond the standard capabilities.
	
This revised prompt challenges you to think beyond the basic deployment setup, pushing you to consider complex scenarios, advanced configurations, and potential challenges that may arise in a real-world deployment. It encourages a deeper exploration of Kubernetes concepts and practices, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of the platform's capabilities."
