5. Revised Prompt:
    "Design a comprehensive architecture for a scalable web application that incorporates Kubernetes for orchestration. The application should consist of multiple microservices, each with their own databases, and should be able to handle high traffic loads effectively. Your design should consider fault tolerance, load balancing, and security measures. Utilize advanced Kubernetes features such as StatefulSets, Ingress controllers, and Network Policies to optimize deployment and ensure robustness. Additionally, create a monitoring and logging strategy to ensure visibility into the system's performance and health. Consider how you would handle rolling updates, automatic scaling, and disaster recovery scenarios within your architecture. Lastly, propose a continuous integration and deployment pipeline that integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes for automated testing and deployment of new features. Be prepared to justify your design decisions and address potential challenges in this scenario."
