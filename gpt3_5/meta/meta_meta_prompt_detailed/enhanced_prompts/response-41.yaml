5. Revised Prompt:
   "You have been tasked with designing a highly scalable and fault-tolerant architecture for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend in a Kubernetes cluster. Your solution should not only meet the basic requirements of container naming, deployments, services, and data persistence but also consider advanced strategies for horizontal scaling, failover mechanisms, and security best practices. Think about how you can leverage advanced Kubernetes features like StatefulSets, Horizontal Pod Autoscalers, Network Policies, and Pod Security Policies to optimize performance, ensure high availability, and protect sensitive data. Consider scenarios where a sudden increase in traffic requires dynamic scaling, or a security breach necessitates rapid response. Develop a detailed plan that demonstrates your ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and anticipate potential challenges in a real-world production environment."
