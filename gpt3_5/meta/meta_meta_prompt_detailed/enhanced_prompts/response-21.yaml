5. [Revised Prompt]:
   "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a scalable and fault-tolerant architecture that deploys a WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend. Consider the following challenges:
	    - Optimize resource allocation and scaling strategies for high availability.
	    - Implement advanced networking configurations to ensure secure communication between containers.
	    - Utilize Helm charts for managing complex application deployments efficiently.
	    - Integrate monitoring and logging solutions to troubleshoot performance issues proactively.
	    - Explore novel approaches to automate backup and disaster recovery mechanisms for data resilience.
   Your manifest should demonstrate a deep understanding of Kubernetes concepts and showcase innovative solutions beyond conventional deployment practices. Think outside the box and experiment with cutting-edge technologies to create a robust and reliable architecture."
