5. [Revised Prompt]:
You are tasked with designing a robust and scalable architecture for a cloud-based application that includes a WordPress website and a MySQL database. Your objective is to create a Kubernetes YAML manifest that not only deploys the WordPress and MySQL containers but also implements advanced features for optimal performance and security.

In your manifest, you need to:
- Implement a horizontal autoscaler for the WordPress Deployment to dynamically adjust the number of replicas based on CPU usage.
- Utilize StatefulSets for the MySQL Deployment to ensure ordered deployment, scaling, and updating of the MySQL Pods.
- Securely store sensitive data such as database passwords using Kubernetes Secrets and ensure they are accessed securely within the cluster.
- Implement network policies to restrict communication between the WordPress and MySQL Pods to only necessary ports and protocols.
- Utilize Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators to automate the backup and restore processes for the MySQL database.

Your manifest should demonstrate a deep understanding of Kubernetes best practices, advanced networking concepts, and security configurations. Think critically about the trade-offs between performance, reliability, and security in your design. Provide detailed justifications for your choices in the manifest documentation.
