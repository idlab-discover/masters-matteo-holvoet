Revised Prompt:
"You are tasked with designing a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database. In addition to the basic requirements of naming containers and setting up Deployments and Services, consider the following advanced challenges:
    - Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for both WordPress and MySQL to handle varying traffic loads.
    - Utilize StatefulSets for MySQL to manage the unique identity of each database instance.
    - Explore using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to extend Kubernetes functionality for specific requirements.
    - Integrate a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment and scaling of the WordPress and MySQL components.
    - Implement Network Policies to control traffic flow between the WordPress frontend and MySQL backend securely.
    - Evaluate using Helm charts for template-based Kubernetes deployments for easier management and customization.
    - Consider implementing a Disaster Recovery plan for data protection and business continuity.
This revised prompt challenges you to think critically and creatively to design a robust and scalable deployment architecture for the WordPress and MySQL components. Your solution should demonstrate innovative problem-solving and a holistic understanding of Kubernetes best practices."
