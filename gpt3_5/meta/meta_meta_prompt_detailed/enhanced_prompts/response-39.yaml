5. Revised Prompt:
    "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a cloud-native application that simulates a real-time streaming analytics platform. The application should consist of multiple microservices, each handling specific data processing tasks. Consider the following aspects:
	    - Define a microservice architecture with at least 3 different types of services, each serving a unique purpose in the data processing pipeline.
	    - Implement container orchestration for scalability and fault tolerance, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
	    - Utilize advanced networking configurations to enable secure communication between the microservices and external systems.
	    - Implement a sophisticated monitoring and logging setup to track and analyze the performance of the application in real-time.
        - Explore the integration of external APIs or services to enrich the data processing capabilities of the platform.
	    - Implement dynamic configuration management using ConfigMaps and Secrets to facilitate seamless deployment and maintenance.
        - Incorporate automated testing and deployment strategies to ensure the reliability and stability of the application."
6. The revised prompt aims to challenge participants to think critically about designing a complex, multi-faceted cloud-native application. It encourages them to consider a diverse range of factors, from architectural design to security and monitoring. By incorporating various elements and scenarios, the prompt fosters a deeper understanding of Kubernetes deployment practices and encourages innovative problem-solving approaches.
