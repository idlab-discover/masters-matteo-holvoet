5. Revised Prompt:
    "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a high-traffic WordPress website that requires advanced scalability and fault tolerance. Your manifest should include the following components:
	    - Implement a horizontal autoscaler for the WordPress Deployment to dynamically adjust the number of replicas based on CPU utilization.
	    - Utilize Kubernetes StatefulSets for the MySQL Deployment to ensure reliable and ordered deployment and scaling of the database.
	    - Implement network policies to restrict traffic between the WordPress and MySQL services for enhanced security.
	    - Utilize Kubernetes Ingress controllers to expose the WordPress website to external traffic, ensuring proper SSL termination and load balancing.
        - Implement a custom resource definition (CRD) to manage scheduled backups of the MySQL database to an external storage provider.
        - Use Kubernetes Helm charts to streamline the deployment process and allow for easy customization and versioning of the entire application stack.
        
     Your design should consider edge cases such as sudden spikes in traffic, database failover scenarios, and compliance requirements for data protection and privacy. Think critically about each component's interaction and performance implications in a distributed system architecture."
