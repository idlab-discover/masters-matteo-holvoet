5. Revised Prompt:
	Create a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website and a MySQL database with advanced scaling capabilities and high availability. Consider the following scenarios:
	- Implement a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for the WordPress deployment to automatically adjust the number of pods based on CPU utilization.
	- Utilize StatefulSets for the MySQL deployment to manage the stateful nature of the database and ensure data consistency.
	- Configure network policies to restrict traffic between the WordPress and MySQL containers for enhanced security.
	- Implement a LoadBalancer service to distribute traffic to multiple WordPress pods for improved performance.
	- Utilize Helm charts for packaging and deploying the WordPress and MySQL applications to streamline the deployment process.
	- Implement PodDisruptionBudgets to ensure that a minimum number of pods are always available for both WordPress and MySQL to maintain service availability.
	- Explore the use of custom resource definitions (CRDs) to extend Kubernetes functionality for advanced monitoring and logging capabilities.
	- Consider implementing rolling updates for both WordPress and MySQL deployments to ensure zero downtime during updates.
	- Evaluate the use of Istio for service mesh capabilities to enhance observability, security, and traffic management between the WordPress and MySQL services.
