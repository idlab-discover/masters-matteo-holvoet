# Part 5: Monitoring and Logging
# Implement monitoring and logging solutions such as Prometheus for monitoring and ELK Stack for logging.

# Part 6: Continuous Integration and Deployment Pipeline
# Integrate CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD with Kubernetes for automated testing and deployment.

# Additional considerations:
# - Implement strategies for rolling updates using Deployment strategies.
# - Set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for automatic scaling based on resource usage.
# - Implement Disaster Recovery mechanisms like backups and multi-region deployments.
