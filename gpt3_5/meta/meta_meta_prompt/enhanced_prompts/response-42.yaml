[Revised Prompt]
Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend that can handle high traffic volume and ensure data integrity. Develop a strategy to configure the WordPress container for optimal performance and security, while also setting up the MySQL container with robust backup and recovery mechanisms. Consider how you would scale the deployment horizontally and vertically to meet changing workload demands. Additionally, propose a disaster recovery plan to ensure minimal downtime in case of system failures. Explore innovative ways to automate deployment processes and integrate monitoring tools for performance optimization. Challenge conventional deployment approaches and strive for cutting-edge solutions that push the boundaries of traditional Kubernetes architecture.
