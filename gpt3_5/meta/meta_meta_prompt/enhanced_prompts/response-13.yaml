"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a scalable WordPress deployment, considering high availability and fault tolerance aspects. Your solution should include deploying multiple WordPress instances with load balancing and MySQL database replication for data durability. Provide detailed configuration for autoscaling based on resource utilization metrics and implement failover mechanisms for seamless service continuity during failures. Ensure efficient resource management and security measures to safeguard sensitive data. Consider incorporating rolling updates for minimal downtime and consider different deployment strategies for optimal performance and cost-efficiency."
