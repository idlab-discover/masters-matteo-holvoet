5. Revised Prompt: "Develop an advanced Kubernetes YAML manifest that orchestrates the deployment of a WordPress website connected to a MySQL database, ensuring high availability and scalability. Consider incorporating advanced Kubernetes features such as StatefulSets and persistent volumes to optimize performance. Challenge traditional deployment architectures and explore innovative ways to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the WordPress-MYSQL setup. Name the WordPress container "wordpress" and the MySQL container "mysql", but also consider additional containers or tools that could further enhance the deployment process. Investigate how different resource allocation strategies can impact the overall performance of the application and propose a robust monitoring and logging solution to ensure the health and security of the deployment."
