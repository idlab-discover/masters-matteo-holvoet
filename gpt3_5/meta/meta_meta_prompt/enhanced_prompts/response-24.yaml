[Revised Prompt]
You are tasked with designing a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a scalable web application deployment. The application consists of a WordPress frontend and a MySQL backend. The WordPress container should be named "wordpress" and the MySQL container should be named "mysql". Additionally, consider implementing auto-scaling capabilities and persistent storage for the MySQL database. How would you architect this deployment to ensure high availability and fault tolerance? How would you handle security considerations and resource optimization in this deployment scenario? Think critically about container orchestration, networking, and monitoring aspects to design an efficient and resilient infrastructure for this application.
