[Revised Prompt]
Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable WordPress website with high availability requirements, utilizing a distributed MySQL database cluster as the backend. Define the WordPress container as "wordpress" and configure it to automatically scale based on traffic demands. Name the MySQL containers as "mysql-primary" and "mysql-replica" to establish a master-slave replication setup for data redundancy and load balancing. Implement advanced security measures to protect sensitive data within the containers and ensure seamless failover mechanisms in case of node failures. Emphasize the use of advanced Kubernetes features such as StatefulSets, Persistent Volumes, and Network Policies to optimize resource utilization and enhance overall system performance.
