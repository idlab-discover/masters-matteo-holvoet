5. Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a microservices architecture that includes a WordPress frontend, a MySQL backend, and an Nginx reverse proxy. Ensure that each component is scalable, fault-tolerant, and deployed in separate pods. Name the WordPress container "web", the MySQL container "db", and the Nginx container "proxy". Implement a persistent volume for storing WordPress data and configure connectivity between the services using Kubernetes networking. Consider security best practices and performance optimization in your design."
