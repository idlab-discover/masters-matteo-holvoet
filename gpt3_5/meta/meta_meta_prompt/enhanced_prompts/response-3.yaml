5. [Revised Prompt]: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a scalable web application infrastructure that includes a WordPress frontend and a MySQL backend. Consider load balancing, high availability, and disaster recovery in your design. Name the WordPress container based on a unique identifier and optimize resources for both containers to ensure efficient performance. Provide detailed annotations explaining your architectural choices and justify your configuration decisions based on best practices in container orchestration." 

6. By revising the input prompt in this manner, it challenges individuals to think beyond basic deployment instructions and encourages them to consider various factors that contribute to a robust and scalable infrastructure. Participants are prompted to delve deeper into concepts such as load balancing, high availability, disaster recovery, resource optimization, and best practices in container orchestration. This approach promotes a holistic understanding of designing complex systems and fosters critical thinking skills by requiring individuals to justify their decisions based on industry standards and emerging trends in the field of DevOps and cloud computing.
