5. Revised Prompt: "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a containerized application that requires high availability, scalability, and security. The application should consist of a WordPress frontend container named "webapp" and a MySQL backend container named "database". Consider implementing horizontal pod autoscaling and persistent volume claims for data storage. Additionally, configure network policies for secure communication between the containers and implement readiness and liveness probes for container health monitoring. Emphasize the separation of concerns and modularity in your design to promote maintainability and flexibility in the deployment architecture."
6. By revising the prompt in this manner, individuals are challenged to think critically about the design considerations beyond just simple deployment instructions. This revised prompt encourages problem-solving skills by incorporating various elements such as scalability, security, reliability, and maintainability, thus promoting a more robust understanding of Kubernetes deployment practices. It also pushes individuals to consider complex scenarios and explore innovative solutions, ultimately enhancing their reasoning capabilities in the field of container orchestration.
