Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a high-traffic WordPress website that requires efficient scaling and fault tolerance mechanisms. Your solution should include deploying multiple WordPress containers named "wordpress1", "wordpress2", and "wordpress3", along with a horizontally scalable MySQL database cluster labeled "mysql-cluster". Implement advanced optimizations for resource allocation, networking configurations, and persistent storage to ensure optimal performance and reliability. Challenge traditional deployment strategies and propose innovative approaches to maximize the platform's capabilities.
