Annotations:
- The WordPress frontend is deployed as a Deployment with 3 replicas to ensure high
  availability and load balancing. Each container is named uniquely for identification
  purposes.
- Resource limits and requests are set for both WordPress and MySQL containers to
  optimize resource allocation and performance efficiency.
- A StatefulSet is used for MySQL backend for stable and unique network identifiers
  which is crucial for databases.
- Separate Services are defined for WordPress and MySQL containers to allow internal
  communication and load balancing efficiently.
- Consideration for disaster recovery can be further enhanced by implementing persistent
  volumes for MySQL data storage and employing backups for WordPress content.
- Following best practices, resource requests and limits are defined to prevent resource
  contention and ensure stability under varying loads.
