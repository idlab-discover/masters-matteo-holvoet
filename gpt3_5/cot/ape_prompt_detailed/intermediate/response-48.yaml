1. ConfigMap for WordPress configuration:
Create a ConfigMap named `wordpress-config` with the necessary configuration for WordPress. This may include WordPress DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, and similar variables.

2. Secret for MySQL password:
Create a Secret named `mysql-password` to store the MySQL root password securely.

3. PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim for MySQL data persistence:
Create a PersistentVolume to store MySQL data and a PersistentVolumeClaim that references this volume for data persistence.

4. MySQL Deployment:
Create a Deployment for MySQL named `mysql` with the following specifications:
- Use the `mysql` image
- Set environmental variables for MySQL root password using the secret `mysql-password`
- Mount the PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence

5. MySQL Service:
Create a Service for MySQL to enable connectivity with WordPress.

6. WordPress Deployment:
Create a Deployment for WordPress named `wordpress` with the following specifications:
- Use the `wordpress` image
- Set environmental variables for WordPress database configuration using the ConfigMap `wordpress-config`
- Mount Secrets for secure WordPress configuration
- Expose port 80 for WordPress

7. WordPress Service:
Create a Service for WordPress to enable connectivity with MySQL and external access.

After implementing these steps in the Kubernetes YAML manifest, you will have a fully deployed WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend, with configurations handled by ConfigMaps and Secrets for security and flexibility.
