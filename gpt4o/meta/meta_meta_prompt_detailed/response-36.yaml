### Explanation:

**High Availability and Fault Tolerance:**
- The WordPress deployment runs with 3 replicas for high availability.
- The MySQL deployment runs with 1 replica but is connected via a Service with `clusterIP: None` (enabling StatefulSet-like behavior) for potential state recovery scenarios.

**Persistent Volume and MySQL Data Integrity:**
- MySQL uses a PVC to store data on a PersistentVolume with a `Retain` reclaim policy, ensuring that data is not deleted when a PVC is released.
- A `ReadWriteOnce` access mode is used ensuring single-node access at any time but providing consistency.

**Services and Networking:**
- The WordPress and MySQL services ensure proper DNS discovery and connectivity within the cluster.
- The WordPress service is exposed using a LoadBalancer type for external access.

**Security with Secrets and ConfigMaps:**
- Sensitive information such as database credentials are stored in Kubernetes Secrets, ensuring they're securely referenced.
- ConfigMaps are used to hold configurations like `wp-config.php`.

**Scaling Considerations:**
- HPAs are implemented for WordPress and MySQL to manage auto-scaling, with resource utilization thresholds defined.
- WordPress deployment can scale across more replicas, while MySQL deployment might require a StatefulSet adaptation for higher resilience.

This design balances cost and complexity by utilizing minimal deployments for MySQL while allowing WordPress to scale more aggressively. Trade-offs include potential database bottlenecks as you scale Wordpress horizontally, mitigated by transitioning the database component to a managed service or StatefulSets when needed.
