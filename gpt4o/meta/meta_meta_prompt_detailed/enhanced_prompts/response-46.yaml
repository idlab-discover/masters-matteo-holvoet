**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest that effectively deploys a robust and secure WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. Consider the following components and scenarios:

- **Complex Deployment Strategy:** Implement a detailed strategy for deploying both WordPress and MySQL. The WordPress deployment should utilize container images optimized for scalability, and the MySQL deployment should emphasize data redundancy and reliability. Choose images mindfully, balancing both performance and security concerns.

- **Data Persistence and Integrity:** Utilize PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence across MySQL pods. Analyze and address potential data consistency challenges that may arise during node failures or scaling events.

- **Service Connectivity and Load Balancing:** Design Services to facilitate seamless communication between WordPress and MySQL. Beyond basic service creation, consider introducing a load balancing mechanism that efficiently handles fluctuating traffic patterns.

- **Dynamic Configuration Management:** Employ ConfigMaps and Secrets to separate configuration data from the container images. Delve into best practices for managing and updating these resources dynamically, ensuring minimal downtime and preventing data leaks.

- **Security and Compliance:** Evaluate the security posture of the deployment, implementing policies to safeguard sensitive data using Kubernetes Secrets. Formulate strategies for compliance with industry standards such as GDPR or PCI DSS.

- **Scenario Planning and Resilience:** Consider potential edge cases that might disrupt service availability, such as a sudden surge in web traffic or database connection issues. Develop a resilience plan that includes auto-scaling policies and health checks for both the frontend and backend.

Approach this task by synthesizing knowledge from disciplines such as cloud architecture, data security, and software engineering. Aim to explore innovative solutions that challenge traditional deployment practices, ensuring a robust, scalable, and secure WordPress website with a MySQL backend." 

This revised prompt is designed to provoke a deeper analytical response, encouraging exploration beyond surface-level deployment strategies while integrating insights from broader technological and conceptual domains.
