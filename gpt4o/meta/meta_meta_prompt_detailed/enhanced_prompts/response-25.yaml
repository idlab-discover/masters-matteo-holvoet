**Revised Prompt:**

"Design and develop a robust Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable WordPress website backed by a resilient MySQL database. As you construct the manifest, critically analyze and address the following complex problem-solving elements:
  
  - Define strategic naming conventions for the WordPress and MySQL containers, beyond simple identifiers like 'wordpress' and 'mysql', to enhance organizational clarity and facilitate larger cross-functional deployments.
  
  - Explore advanced deployment strategies for WordPress, such as blue-green deployments or canary releases, to minimize downtime and ensure smooth updates. Evaluate the trade-offs between different strategies and justify your selection in the manifest.

  - Architect a MySQL deployment that leverages high availability and failover mechanisms using Read Replicas or StatefulSets to enhance data integrity and fault tolerance, along with PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence.

  - Devise and articulate a networking strategy for the Services that optimizes intra-cluster traffic flow and considers the implications of Service discovery and load balancing for both WordPress and MySQL. Discuss how this setup can be adapted for multi-region or hybrid cloud environments.

  - Implement ConfigMaps and Secrets for application and infrastructure configurations. Reflect on the security implications and compliance requirements for managing sensitive data, and propose a method for automated secrets rotation and management.

  This exercise should encourage a synthesis of knowledge from cloud infrastructure, application lifecycle management, and data security disciplines. Aim to challenge conventional monolithic design approaches through modular and scalable architecture, considering the perspectives of developers, operations teams, and security analysts."
