**Revised Prompt:**

"Develop a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable and secure WordPress website with a MySQL database serving as the backend. In this task, carefully consider the following advanced requirements:

- Architect the WordPress component to ensure high availability and load balancing, likely by implementing multiple replicas and employing a HorizontalPodAutoscaler. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and explore the implications of choosing different container images in terms of security and performance.
- Configure the MySQL component to handle data persistence effectively, requiring sophisticated use of PersistentVolumeClaims. Name the MySQL container 'mysql' and explore the trade-offs between different storage classes and access modes.
- Establish Services for both WordPress and MySQL that facilitate seamless connectivity and load balancing, potentially leveraging ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer types. Critically evaluate the security implications of each type.
- Construct ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration files and sensitive data. Examine best practices for securing Secrets and encrypting data at rest.
- Lastly, consider how you would implement observability and monitoring for this application stack. Evaluate existing tools and strategies to ensure the entire system remains performant and secure, particularly under stress or failure scenarios.

Through this exercise, synthesize information from Kubernetes, networking, security, and database management disciplines to produce a robust solution. Anticipate potential pitfalls and present alternative strategies, fostering a mindset that challenges conventional deployment methodologies."
