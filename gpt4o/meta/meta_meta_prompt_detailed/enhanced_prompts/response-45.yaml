Revised Prompt:

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest for a robust deployment of a WordPress website utilizing a MySQL database backend. Consider and address the following complex challenges:

- Develop a scalable architecture that not only names the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql' but also anticipates future growth and high availability requirements.
- Formulate a multi-layered approach to deploying WordPress, including specifying optimal container images, ports, and environment variables for seamless database connectivity, while ensuring minimal downtime during updates.
- Engineer a resilient MySQL Deployment, carefully integrating PersistentVolumeClaims to safeguard data integrity across potential node failures.
- Architect Kubernetes Services for WordPress and MySQL that facilitate secure and efficient connectivity, employing best practices in network policy and service discovery.
- Implement ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage both configuration data and sensitive information, devising a strategy that minimizes exposure and maximizes operational security.
- Address unconventional scenarios, such as handling the periodic scaling of resources, adapting to varying traffic patterns, and preparing for unexpected outages or migrations.

Construct your solution with detailed reasoning that evaluates various trade-offs, integrates cross-domain knowledge, and challenges conventional approaches to foster innovative solutions."
