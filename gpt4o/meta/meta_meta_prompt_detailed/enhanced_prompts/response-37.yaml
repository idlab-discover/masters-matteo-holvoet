Revised Prompt:

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes deployment strategy for a robust and scalable WordPress website backed by a MySQL database. Consider the following parameters to ensure resilience, security, and efficiency:

- Analyze the implications of containerizing WordPress and MySQL separately. Determine the optimal image versions and evaluate the trade-offs of using pre-built images versus custom-built ones.

- Develop a detailed configuration for a WordPress Deployment, considering the network configuration, port management, and setting environment variables crucial for seamless database communication. Justify your choices based on best practices in container orchestration.

- Construct a MySQL Deployment with a focus on safeguarding data integrity using PersistentVolumeClaims. Explore alternative data storage strategies and compare their pros and cons in context.

- Engineer Services for both WordPress and MySQL that consider failover scenarios and load balancing. How could these architectural decisions affect the overall user experience and scalability?

- Leverage ConfigMaps and Secrets for managing application configuration and sensitive data. Discuss the potential security challenges and propose solutions to mitigate these risks effectively.

- Consider additional factors such as resource limitations, compliance requirements, and geographic distribution in your deployment model. How might these influence your configuration decisions? 

Ultimately, synthesize your findings into a set of recommendations that would convince a technical lead of your deployment's viability and readiness for production use. Provide well-reasoned arguments for your design choices to facilitate a broader discourse on deploying containerized applications within Kubernetes."
