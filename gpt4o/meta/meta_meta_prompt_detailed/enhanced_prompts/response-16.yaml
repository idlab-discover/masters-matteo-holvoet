### Revised Prompt:

Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a robust and scalable WordPress application with a MySQL database backend. The task requires not only the basic deployment but also an emphasis on security, scalability, and disaster recovery to address real-world complexities:

1. **Infrastructure Setup:**
   - Create separate Deployments for both WordPress ("wordpress") and MySQL ("mysql") using appropriate container images. Ensure the YAML file includes necessary container details such as resource requests and limits to balance performance with cost-effectiveness.
   - Integrate services for both applications to manage internal and external connectivity, exploring different ways to optimize network configurations.

2. **Data Persistence and Security:**
   - Configure PersistentVolumeClaims for the MySQL database to ensure data persistence, even in the event of a pod restart. Investigate alternative storage options, like cloud-based volumes, that might offer enhanced reliability.
   - Utilize ConfigMaps and Secrets not just for environmental variables and sensitive data (such as database credentials), but also to explore encryption methods and security best practices that prevent unauthorized access.

3. **High Availability and Scalability:**
   - Propose a strategy that enables scaling the WordPress deployment dynamically based on traffic, making use of Horizontal Pod Autoscalers or similar mechanisms to handle varying loads efficiently.
   - Consider implementing a backup and recovery plan within the Kubernetes ecosystem for both WordPress and MySQL, ensuring quick recovery from failures.

4. **Complex Problem Solving:**
   - Investigate potential complications arising from using multiple namespaces for isolating different parts of your application, and reason through how this may impact service discovery and networking.
   - Examine how your configuration might handle configuration changes or updates, minimizing downtime and maintaining service continuity.

5. **Broader Exploration:**
   - Analyze how the adoption of various logging and monitoring solutions can provide insights into performance issues and security threats, integrating tools like Prometheus or Grafana if applicable.
   - Explore how the integration of your system with external authentication providers (like OAuth or LDAP) may enhance user management capabilities while maintaining secure operations.

Reflect on how these configurations will function in a cloud-native environment and consider how best practices from other disciplines could inform your decisions, such as software architecture principles and systems reliability engineering.
