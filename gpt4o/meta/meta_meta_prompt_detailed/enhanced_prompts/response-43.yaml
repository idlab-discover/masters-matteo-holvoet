Revised Prompt:
"Design a robust Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a scalable WordPress website with a highly available MySQL database backend. As you develop this configuration, integrate the following elements:

- Architect the solution to address fault tolerance and load balancing across multiple nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql', while considering potential naming conflicts and scalability constraints.
- Implement a Deployment for WordPress that selects optimal container images, and efficiently manages ports and environment variables to ensure secure and performant database connectivity.
- Develop a redundant MySQL setup utilizing PersistentVolumeClaims and PersistentVolumes, ensuring both data persistence and recovery from potential failures.
- Construct Services for both WordPress and MySQL that facilitate seamless inter-component connectivity and adhere to best practices for security and reliability.
- Employ ConfigMaps and Secrets judiciously for configuration management and the safeguarding of sensitive data, while also considering edge cases like key rotation and access control.
- Evaluate the implementation's resilience against database integrity issues, and identify strategies for optimizing resource allocation across the cluster.

Critically assess how these solutions synergize with the broader needs of a cloud-native ecosystem, navigating complexities such as service discovery, network policies, and application scaling. Present your architectural choices with supporting rationale, drawing upon cross-disciplinary insights from fields like distributed systems, cloud architecture, and DevOps practices."
