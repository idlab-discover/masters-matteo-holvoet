**Revised Prompt:**

"Devise a comprehensive Kubernetes architecture to robustly deploy a WordPress website backed by a MySQL database. Your task includes not only creating a detailed YAML manifest but also addressing several advanced considerations outlined below:

- **Multi-Layered Decomposition:** Break down the deployment into its core components and discuss the interplay between WordPress and MySQL within the Kubernetes ecosystem.

- **Component Naming and Configuration:** Name the containers explicitly as 'wordpress' and 'mysql'. Delve into the selection of container images, justifying the choice based on performance, security, and compatibility.

- **Resilience and Data Integrity:** Design the MySQL Deployment with PersistentVolumeClaims, ensuring data persistence. Analyze potential points of failure and propose redundancy measures to address data integrity and service continuity.

- **Service Connectivity and Network Policies:** Construct Services to facilitate seamless connectivity between WordPress and MySQL. Develop network policies that tightly control and monitor traffic, aligning with best security practices.

- **Environmental and Sensitive Data Management:** Utilize ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration and handling sensitive information. Reflect on the challenges of managing these resources at scale, proposing solutions for encryption, access control, and lifecycle management.

- **Performance Optimization:** Explore techniques to optimize the performance of your deployment, such as resource requests/limits, autoscaling strategies, and efficient caching mechanisms.

- **Innovative Scenarios:** Consider a scenario where traffic spikes dramatically due to a sudden growth in WordPress popularity. Explain how your design adapts to this challenge, ensuring high availability and minimal latency.

- **Interdisciplinary Insights:** In your approach, draw insights from fields such as security engineering, data management, and cloud infrastructure. Highlight how these diverse perspectives contribute to a more robust deployment strategy.

The outcome of your resulting implementation should reflect a strategic, holistic understanding of deploying WordPress in a Kubernetes environment, integrating troubleshooting abilities, and anticipating evolving infrastructural requirements."
