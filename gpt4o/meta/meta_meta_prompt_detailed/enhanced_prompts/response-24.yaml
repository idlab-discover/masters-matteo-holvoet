Revised Prompt:

"Design an advanced Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a highly available WordPress website, alongside a resilient MySQL database, considering scalability and security best practices. The manifest should achieve the following objectives:

- Architect the WordPress setup to handle increase in traffic surges with auto-scaling capabilities integrated. Analyze potential bottlenecks and propose optimizations in both the application and database tiers.
- Implement a multi-node MySQL cluster with read replicas to enhance data availability and query performance. Assess the implications of such a setup in terms of data consistency and fault tolerance.
- Introduce sophisticated mechanisms for persistent data storage in the MySQL cluster, using PersistentVolumeClaims with strategies to manage potential node failures.
- Design secure communication channels between WordPress and MySQL, possibly leveraging Kubernetes Network Policies and Ingress controllers. Evaluate the trade-offs of these decisions on network latency and security.
- Deploy ConfigMaps for scalable configuration management and Secrets for handling sensitive information with robust access controls. Critically analyze different encryption and access pattern strategies to secure sensitive data.
- Design services that facilitate seamless connectivity while considering the impact of external traffic on system load and user experience.

Encourage reflection on the interdependencies between application layer design and Kubernetes resource management. Explore innovative approaches that leverage cutting-edge technologies or methodologies to enhance reliability and performance of the system."
