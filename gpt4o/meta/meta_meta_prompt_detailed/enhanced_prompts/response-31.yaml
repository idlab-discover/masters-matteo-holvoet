**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes infrastructure to deploy a robust WordPress website with a MySQL database backend, considering best practices for scalability, security, and reliability. Your Kubernetes YAML manifest should address the following multi-layered components and challenges:

- Optimize the deployment strategy for both WordPress (container named 'wordpress') and MySQL (container named 'mysql'), considering horizontal scaling. Define suitable container images, set up network ports, and configure environment variables for seamless database communication.
- Establish a MySQL Deployment with a focus on high data integrity and availability. Architect a PersistentVolumeClaim strategy that accommodates potential cloud provider limitations and elaborate on how you would handle data backup and disaster recovery.
- Implement Kubernetes Services for both WordPress and MySQL to ensure efficient load balancing and internal/external connectivity. Evaluate the pros and cons of different service types like NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ClusterIP in your explanation.
- Leverage ConfigMaps and Secrets for external configuration management and the secure handling of sensitive data such as database credentials. Discuss potential security vulnerabilities and propose solutions to mitigate these risks.
- Present a scenario where your deployment must withstand a sudden traffic spike due to a marketing campaign. Analyze how your setup can be adapted or modified to efficiently handle this challenge without service disruption.
- Finally, provide a brief consideration of hybrid cloud deployments where components might reside in different environments (on-premises and cloud). Discuss how this might affect your Kubernetes setup and the measures you would take to ensure coherent operations across distributed environments."

This revised prompt encourages advanced critical and analytical thinking by integrating elements requiring multi-step reasoning, allowing for exploration of various deployment strategies, security issues, and scalability solutions while promoting synthesis from different technological domains.
