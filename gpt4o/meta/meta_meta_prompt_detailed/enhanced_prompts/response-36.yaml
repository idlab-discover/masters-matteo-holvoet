Revised Prompt:

"Design a robust Kubernetes solution for deploying a resilient WordPress site with a MySQL database backend. The solution should address the following intricate challenges and considerations:

- How would you ensure high availability and fault tolerance for both the WordPress and MySQL components within the Kubernetes cluster? Specify your strategies using Kubernetes resources.
- Develop a Deployment for the WordPress application, including detailed container image specifications, exposed ports, and correctly configured environment variables that dynamically adapt to database credential changes.
- Construct a MySQL Deployment that leverages PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) to maintain data integrity and continuity in case of node failures. Consider the implications of using different storage classes and access modes on data accessibility and recovery.
- Implement a secure, seamless connectivity workflow between the WordPress front-end and MySQL backend using Kubernetes Services, accounting for potential network latency and ensuring minimal downtime during updates.
- Demonstrate how you would utilize ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage both configuration and sensitive data (such as database passwords or API keys) securely, highlighting any other security concerns that should be addressed.
- Reflect on potential scaling challenges and propose solutions for efficiently auto-scaling both applications, while considering CPU and memory resource constraints.
- Highlight any trade-offs or considerations your design might need to address in terms of cost, complexity, or scalability, and propose innovative solutions to balance these factors.

Through this exercise, encourage a holistic assessment of how Kubernetes resources can be leveraged to design a scalable, secure, and responsive web application infrastructure."
