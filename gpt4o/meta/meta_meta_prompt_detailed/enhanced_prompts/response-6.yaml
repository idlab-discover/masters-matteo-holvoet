Revised Prompt:

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a robust WordPress website, leveraging a MySQL database for backend operations. Consider the following elements to enhance resilience, security, and scalability:

- Clearly define and name your WordPress container as 'wordpress' and your MySQL container as 'mysql', ensuring these reflect best practices in container labeling and management.

- Develop a Deployment strategy for WordPress that not only includes selecting appropriate container images and configuring ports, but also involves setting up environment variables meticulously to interact seamlessly with the MySQL database.

- Construct a robust Deployment plan for MySQL, incorporating PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence even in the face of node failures. Discuss how different storage classes might impact performance and recovery.

- Design Services that ensure optimal connectivity between WordPress and MySQL, and explore the implications of different service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer). How do these service types affect network configuration and external accessibility?

- Integrate ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management and sensitive data protection. How would you manage the lifecycle of these ConfigMaps and Secrets in dynamic environments, where configurations change frequently?

- Consider how you might implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling to handle varying levels of website traffic both for WordPress and MySQL components. What monitoring tools would be employed to facilitate scaling decisions?

- Discuss potential challenges in this deployment, such as handling application restarts or managing database migrations, and propose strategies to mitigate such issues.

Through this task, aim to synthesize insights from cloud-native architectures, security principles, and operational best practices to build a comprehensive solution that challenges conventional approaches, fosters deep analytical reasoning, and incorporates multi-faceted problem-solving techniques."
