Revised Prompt:

"Design a fully operational Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a robust WordPress website paired with a MySQL database for dynamic backend functioning. When crafting your solution, consider the following advanced aspects and provide a rationale for each choice:

- Assign the names 'wordpress' to the WordPress container and 'mysql' to the MySQL container, while justifying the naming convention in terms of maintainability and scalability.
- Construct a Deployment for the WordPress application, selecting appropriate container images and configuring ports. Delve into the specific environment variables necessary for seamless database connectivity and elaborate on the choice of configurations that bolster security and performance.
- Forge a Deployment for MySQL that incorporates PersistentVolumeClaims. Examine the impact of data persistence on both system reliability and recovery scenarios, and explain how your configuration choices mitigate potential data loss.
- Develop Services for both WordPress and MySQL, detailing how they facilitate inter-container connectivity and external accessibility. Analyze the balance between openness for user traffic and restricting potential vulnerabilities.
- Implement ConfigMaps and Secrets to effectively manage configuration data and sensitive information, discussing strategies for securing sensitive data in dynamic environments. Explore alternative approaches and weigh their benefits and drawbacks.
- Introduce an additional layer of complexity by considering how your manifest could accommodate future scaling requirements and evolving application needs. Discuss potential modifications and enhancements to your current design, such as integrating monitoring or implementing a high availability setup."
