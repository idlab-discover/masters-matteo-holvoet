Revised Prompt:

"Design a robust Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a scalable WordPress website with a secure and persistent MySQL backend. As you develop the manifest, consider the following challenging multi-step requirements:

- Construct two separate Deployments: one for a WordPress container named "wordpress" and another for a MySQL container named "mysql". Reflect on the implications of container resource allocation for each component, ensuring optimal performance.

- Deliberate on the choice of container images for WordPress and MySQL, factoring in both security aspects and potential future upgrades. Justify your selections based on their latest features and community support.

- Incorporate multi-layered infrastructure to support resilience and uptime. Utilize PersistentVolumeClaims for enduring data storage, contemplating the failover strategies and data backup mechanisms.

- Architect services that not only facilitate connectivity between WordPress and MySQL but also critically evaluate network policies that enhance security and access control across different namespaces.

- Leverage ConfigMaps and Secrets, but challenge conventional approaches by exploring alternative methods for environment configuration and sensitive data management. Consider scenarios where dynamic configurations may be required and propose solutions for automated updates.

By embracing a holistic design approach, reconcile the technical intricacies of resource management, scalability, and security, while fostering a robust, future-proof application architecture."
