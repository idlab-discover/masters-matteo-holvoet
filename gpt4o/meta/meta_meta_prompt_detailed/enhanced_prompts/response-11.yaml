**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a robust WordPress website coupled with a scalable MySQL database backend. Consider the following complex scenarios and challenges:

- Ensure the WordPress container is named 'wordpress' and the MySQL container is named 'mysql', but anticipate potential scalability needs for both applications.
- Develop separate Deployments for WordPress and MySQL, choosing optimal container images and configuring necessary ports. Critically evaluate various database configuration strategies using environment variables.
- Implement data persistence for MySQL using PersistentVolumeClaims. Discuss the trade-offs between different storage classes and access modes in the context of database performance and availability.
- Establish Services for connectivity, analyzing options for exposing the WordPress website to external traffic while ensuring secure and efficient internal communication with the MySQL backend.
- Utilize ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data securely. Explore best practices for updating and rotating these resources without downtime.
- Introduce fault-tolerance and auto-scaling capabilities to the deployment. Assess the implications of these features on resource consumption, cost, and application stability.
- Challenge conventional deployment practices by considering alternative architectures, such as leveraging StatefulSets for database management or employing Helm charts for templated configurations.

In crafting your solution, synthesize information from cloud-native, security, and database administration domains. Provide a narrative explaining your decisions and thought processes, emphasizing the rationale behind each design choice in the face of these challenges."
