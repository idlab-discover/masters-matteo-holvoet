Revised Prompt:

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a robust and scalable WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. For this task, consider the following complex requirements to enhance your reasoning and problem-solving capabilities:

- Utilize advanced Kubernetes concepts to ensure high availability and scalability of the WordPress application.
- Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. However, challenge conventional configurations by optimizing resources and exploring alternative approaches to manage container workloads efficiently.
- Implement a WordPress Deployment with appropriately selected container images, ensuring compatibility and performance optimization. Explain your choice of ports and environment variables, particularly how they contribute to secure and efficient database configuration.
- Create a MySQL Deployment, emphasizing data persistence and disaster recovery strategies using PersistentVolumeClaims. Consider different storage classes and how they impact performance and cost-effectiveness.
- Develop Services for both WordPress and MySQL, ensuring reliable connectivity and testing the resilience of your configuration under different network conditions.
- Innovatively utilize ConfigMaps and Secrets beyond basic use cases for configuration management and safeguarding sensitive data. Explain how these tools can be used to dynamically facilitate changes and manage application scaling challenges.
- Anticipate and address potential security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks. Evaluate multiple mitigation strategies and justify your choices based on evidence or theoretical knowledge from other technical domains.

Provide a detailed reflection on your design choices, exploring the impact of these decisions across different scenarios, including system failures, resource spikes, and scale-up events. Facilitate a discussion on the balance between simplicity and complexity in Kubernetes design, supported by your synthesized information."
