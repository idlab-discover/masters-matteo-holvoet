**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a robust and scalable Kubernetes deployment strategy for hosting a WordPress website with a MySQL database as its backend. Your solution should address the following considerations:

- **Container Structure and Naming:** Assign descriptive and purpose-driven names to your containers, specifying their roles ("wordpress-frontend" and "mysql-backend"), and evaluate the implications of these roles on resource allocation and cluster management.

- **Deployment Strategy:** Develop a dual Deployment configuration, providing comprehensive justifications for your choices in container images, ports, and environment variables. Assess the trade-offs between rolling updates and canary deployments to ensure minimal downtime and data integrity throughout updates.

- **Data Persistence Solutions:** Implement PersistentVolumeClaims for the MySQL database. Critique the viability of different storage classes and strategies for data redundancy and backup within a cloud-native architecture, considering cost, scalability, and recovery time objectives.

- **Service Discovery and Connectivity:** Design Services to facilitate reliable communication between the WordPress front-end and the MySQL back-end. Investigate the impact of service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) on security, cost, and user experience. Construct a plan for efficient DNS management within Kubernetes.

- **Configuration Management:** Leverage ConfigMaps and Secrets, balancing the need for flexibility and security. Explore how environmental constraints might affect configuration decisions and propose solutions to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive data in various deployment scenarios.

- **Advanced Problem Solving:** Consider external factors, such as unexpected demand spikes, security threats, and migration challenges, and propose strategies for addressing these through Kubernetes-native features or complementary technologies.

By approaching these tasks, you should foster not only a detailed understanding of Kubernetes' capabilities but also explore and synthesize information from cloud computing, networking, and data management to create a comprehensive deployment strategy." 

This revised prompt emphasizes deeper analytical thinking, challenges conventional assumptions, and promotes the integration of knowledge from multiple domains to address complex scenarios.
