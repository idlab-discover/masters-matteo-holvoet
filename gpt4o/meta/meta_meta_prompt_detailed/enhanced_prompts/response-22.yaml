Revised Prompt:

"Devise a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable and secure WordPress website integrated with a MySQL database as the backend. Consider the following advanced requirements to stimulate complex problem-solving and reasoning:

- Assign the WordPress container a distinct name 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Beyond naming, evaluate how these services interact under different network conditions and consider future scaling.
- Develop a detailed Deployment configuration for WordPress. Decide on optimal container images and justify your choice, configure ports for scalability, and establish robust environment variables for seamless database interaction. Explore various strategies for handling database downtime or lag.
- Create a Deployment for MySQL ensuring data durability and recovery through PersistentVolumeClaims. Analyze different storage class options for performance versus cost efficiency, and plan for future data scaling needs.
- Set up Services to facilitate connectivity between WordPress and MySQL. Reflect on different service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) and their impact on security and accessibility. Propose strategies to mitigate potential latency issues.
- Innovate a secure system for managing configurations and sensitive data using ConfigMaps and Secrets. Assess the potential risks of data breaches and rule out common vulnerabilities.
- Discuss potential failure scenarios and design a robust recovery plan. How would you handle partial outages or unexpected traffic spikes while maintaining high availability and performance?
- Consider the implications of different deployment solutions in varied environments (on-premises vs. cloud-based Kubernetes clusters) and their impact on system security and responsiveness.

Through this exercise, the goal is to stimulate multi-step reasoning, encourage the analysis of various configurations, and foster the synthesis of technical and strategic considerations from diverse domains to achieve an optimized deployment solution."
