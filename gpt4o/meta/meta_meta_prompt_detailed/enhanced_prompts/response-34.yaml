Revised Prompt:

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a scalable and secure WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend. Your task is to address the following requirements and challenges:

- Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Employ state-of-the-art container images for optimal performance.
- Architect a Deployment for WordPress that includes container configurations like image selection suitable for high traffic, port specifications, and dynamic environment variables sourced from external configurations.
- Develop a Deployment for MySQL with a focus on ensuring high availability and data integrity. Incorporate PersistentVolumeClaims to ensure data persistence even in the event of component failure.
- Provide robust Services for both WordPress and MySQL to facilitate reliable connectivity and seamless interaction, including consideration for internal DNS and potential network policies.
- Leverage ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage both configuration and sensitive data effectively, balancing usability with security best practices.
- As part of your design, propose strategies that address horizontal scaling, load balancing, and automated database backups to enhance the overall resilience and scalability of the system.
- Consider edge cases such as sudden traffic surges, potential security vulnerabilities, and resource optimization. Document your decision-making process, highlighting trade-offs and justifications for chosen approaches.

In your solution, explore the intersections of cloud infrastructure demands, security mandates, and the need for continuous application uptime, synthesizing information from diverse Kubernetes best practices and real-world deployment scenarios to deliver a resilient and scalable architecture."
