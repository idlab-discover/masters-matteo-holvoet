**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a robust, scalable WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. While constructing this setup, consider the following challenges:

- Design a failover mechanism to ensure high availability for both WordPress and MySQL components. Discuss the implications of using Deployments versus StatefulSets for each component concerning data consistency and recovery speed.
- Incorporate a strategy to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities, focusing on the separation of concerns and the principle of least privilege. Explore how NetworkPolicies, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Seccomp profiles can be implemented in your design.
- For persistent data storage, evaluate the use of different storage classes and their impact on performance and cost, providing a rationale for your choice in configuring PersistentVolumeClaims for MySQL.
- Utilize ConfigMaps and Secrets not only for separating configuration from code and managing sensitive data but also explore their impact on application scalability and maintainability. Discuss potential pitfalls of mismanagement.
- Develop a Service mesh strategy to ensure seamless communication between WordPress and MySQL Pods, considering microservice architecture scalability and fault tolerance. Examine the trade-offs of potential Service types and ingress configurations.

Through this exercise, articulate the decision-making process, considering various technical domains such as security, resilience, storage efficiency, and network communication. Aim to balance these elements while achieving a harmonious, high-performing cloud-native deployment."
