Revised Prompt:

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest that seamlessly integrates a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend, facing complex deployment challenges. Your task includes:

- Structuring the deployment of WordPress and MySQL containers, named 'wordpress' and 'mysql' respectively, to ensure robust interaction and data flow. Analyze how your design mitigates potential downtime and maintains application resilience.
  
- Crafting a detailed Deployment plan for WordPress. Select optimal container images, configure ports, and strategically set environment variables for database connectivity. Consider how changing traffic patterns might affect resource allocation and performance.

- Developing a Deployment strategy for MySQL, utilizing PersistentVolumeClaims for data integrity and durability across potential node failures. Evaluate the trade-offs between data consistency and availability.

- Constructing Services for enabling seamless connectivity between WordPress and MySQL. Explore how various network policies and load balancing techniques could impact the systemâ€™s security posture and scalability.

- Employing ConfigMaps and Secrets thoughtfully to manage configuration settings and sensitive information. Assess different approaches to encrypt sensitive data and rotate credentials without downtime.

- Assuming a scenario where your deployment must adapt to a sudden spike in traffic or a partial infrastructure failure. Examine how your manifest can be adapted or extended to handle such situations effectively, incorporating redundancy and failover mechanisms.

Through this task, aim to showcase a multi-faceted understanding of Kubernetes architecture while anticipating potential deployment pitfalls. Consider perspectives from security, operations, and development to create a sustainable deployment model."
