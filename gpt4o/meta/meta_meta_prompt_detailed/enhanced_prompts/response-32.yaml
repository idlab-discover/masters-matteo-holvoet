Revised Prompt:

"Design a sophisticated Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable and robust WordPress website with a secure and resilient MySQL database as its backend. As you create the manifest, consider the following advanced requirements and challenges:

- Challenge yourself to architect a deployment strategy that not only meets the basic functional requirements but also incorporates scalability and high availability.
- For the WordPress Deployment, utilize container images, ports, and database configuration environment variables, and explore advanced optimization techniques like resource limits and readiness/liveness probes.
- In designing the MySQL Deployment, ensure that PersistentVolumeClaims are configured for reliable data persistence, and evaluate different storage solutions for enhanced performance under high load conditions.
- Devise Services for WordPress and MySQL that not only enable connectivity but also offer security and fault tolerance. Consider edge cases like network partitioning and how to handle them gracefully.
- Utilize ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management and the protection of sensitive data. Reflect on best practices for secure data handling and explore cutting-edge solutions for encrypting data in transit and at rest.
- Consider how these elements integrate into a broader cloud-native ecosystem. Challenge conventional thinking by investigating alternative approaches, such as using StatefulSets for MySQL or implementing Ingress for external access.
- Your solution should be adaptable to various deployment environments (e.g., on-premises, major cloud providers) and take into account different scaling needs and potential future integrations with other services.

Ultimately, your approach should demonstrate a holistic understanding, incorporating cross-disciplinary insights from areas such as security, networking, and system architecture."
