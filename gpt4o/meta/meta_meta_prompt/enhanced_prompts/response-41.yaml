Revised Prompt:

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest that incorporates best practices for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend. Consider the following challenges and constraints: ensuring high availability, implementing secure configuration standards, and optimizing for scalability. Analyze and detail the use of persistent storage for both the WordPress and MySQL containers. Additionally, explore strategies for automated backups of the database and seamless version updates for the WordPress application. Discuss the implications of these strategies on resource management and how they would adapt to both increasing traffic demands and potential security threats. Provide justifications for your design choices, taking into account modern DevOps methodologies and the principles of robust system architecture."
