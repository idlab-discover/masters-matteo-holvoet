**Revised Prompt:** 

"Develop a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a robust and secure WordPress website, employing a MySQL database as its backend. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql.' In your solution, consider the following:

1. Detail the steps necessary to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for both the WordPress and MySQL components. 
2. Outline security measures for the deployment, including network policies, secure data storage, and access controls. 
3. Devise a scalable architecture that dynamically adjusts to variable loads, ensuring optimal resource utilization and performance.
4. Integrate advanced monitoring and logging capabilities to facilitate real-time diagnostics and proactive system management.
5. Explore potential challenges in orchestrating this deployment in a cloud environment, and propose strategic solutions to overcome them.
   
Reflect on how these elements intersect with best practices in cloud-native development, and suggest innovative approaches that could enhance the deployment's resilience and efficiency. Encourage consideration of trade-offs and risks associated with your design choices." 

This revised prompt is intended to promote critical thinking by encouraging analysis of complex, interconnected factors and redefining conventional deployment strategies through comprehensive problem-solving and innovative thinking.
