[Revised Prompt]  
"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable and resilient WordPress site with a MySQL database as the backend. Consider the following requirements and constraints: 

1. The WordPress container should be named 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'.
2. Implement an architecture that supports high availability and seamless failover, keeping both containers and their data durable and accessible during potential pod or node failures.
3. Integrate security best practices, including data encryption and secure transmission for both WordPress and MySQL.
4. Optimize resource allocations to balance performance and cost-efficiency, taking into account potential traffic spikes to the WordPress site.
5. Enable monitoring and logging to provide insights into application health and user activity.
6. Discuss how you would handle rolling updates to both WordPress and MySQL without disrupting the service availability.
7. Reflect on potential scalability issues and propose strategies to address these as the WordPress site grows in terms of user base and content volume.

Draft a plan detailing your approach, the reasoning behind each design choice, and any trade-offs that may arise. Consider how your solution could apply to similar use cases across different domains."

This revised prompt encourages exploration of complex architectural considerations, integrating various technical disciplines, and requires the synthesis of knowledge to solve the problem.
