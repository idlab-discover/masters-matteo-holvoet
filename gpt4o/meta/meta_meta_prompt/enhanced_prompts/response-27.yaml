Revised Prompt:

"Design a comprehensive and scalable Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website integrated with a MySQL database as its backend. Consider the following:

- Ensure the WordPress application is resilient to traffic surges, exploring the use of Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.
- Analyze the trade-offs between different storage solutions for database persistence and choose an optimal strategy for the MySQL container.
- Incorporate best practices for ensuring communication security between the WordPress and MySQL containers, such as network policies and encryption methods.
- Discuss how the configuration supports both development and production environments, addressing potential challenges in data migration and backup strategies.
- Consider the implications of using open-source tools and the impact on update and maintenance cycles.
- Evaluate the need for an external load balancer and its configuration to manage incoming traffic efficiently.

By addressing these considerations, create a deployment plan that not only meets current requirements but is also adaptable to future demands."
