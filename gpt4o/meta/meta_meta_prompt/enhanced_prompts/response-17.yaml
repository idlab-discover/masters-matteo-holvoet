Revised Prompt: 

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend, considering best practices for scalability, security, and resilience. Begin by outlining the architectural components required, such as services, deployments, and volume configurations. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Then, detail a multi-step reasoning process for implementing resource management, such as setting up persistent storage for data durability and defining resource limits for optimal performance. Further, integrate security measures like secret management and network policies. Additionally, discuss potential challenges and unconventional solutions that could arise during deployment, particularly in maintaining high availability and handling traffic spikes. Finally, reflect on how insights from fields like data engineering and cybersecurity could be applied to enhance the robustness of your deployment strategy."
