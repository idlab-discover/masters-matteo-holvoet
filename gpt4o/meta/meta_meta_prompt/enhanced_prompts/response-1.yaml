[Revised Prompt]  
"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifesto for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend. Beyond basic deployment, consider the following:  

1. Explore strategies to ensure high availability and resilience for both WordPress and MySQL. How would you architect the YAML manifest to handle node failures or rolling updates without downtime?  
2. Incorporate advanced networking configurations to optimize communication between WordPress and the MySQL database, ensuring security and performance. What Network Policies or Services would you implement?  
3. Develop a scalable solution by thinking about horizontal scaling for traffic spikes. How would you configure autoscaling for the WordPress container, and how should the database be provisioned to keep up with scale changes?
4. Consider the stateful nature of the MySQL container and discuss strategies for persistent data storage. How would you configure Persistent Volume Claims and manage data backups and recovery in case of data corruption or accidental deletion?
5. Address potential security threats and propose enhancements. How could you employ Kubernetes tools or configurations to secure the containers, maintain data integrity, and protect against cyber threats?

In your solution, provide detailed reasoning and justification for each architectural decision and configuration setting. Consider cross-domain tools or practices, such as CI/CD pipelines, to further enhance deployment reliability and efficiency."  

This prompt encourages a multi-faceted approach, challenging conventional thinking by incorporating high-level problem-solving with real-world production concerns.
