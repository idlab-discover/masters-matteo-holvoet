**[Revised Prompt]**: 

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend. As you work through this task, consider the following multi-step challenges: 

1. Specify best practices for securing the database connection between the WordPress and MySQL containers while ensuring efficient load handling.
2. Explore strategies for scaling the application, addressing how you would manage increased traffic and database demands over time.
3. Utilize environment variables and secrets to manage sensitive configuration data, ensuring that your approach aligns with Kubernetes' best security practices.
4. Provide methods for persistent storage solutions for both WordPress and MySQL containers, emphasizing data continuity and reliability.
5. Discuss potential implications on website performance and data integrity if either container were to fail, and propose failover strategies.

By addressing these elements, aim to develop a robust and scalable deployment that anticipates operational challenges and provides a resilient solution."
