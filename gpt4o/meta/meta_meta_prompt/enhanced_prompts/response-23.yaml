**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes deployment strategy to host a scalable WordPress website with high availability and robust data integrity, using a MySQL database for backend support. The deployment must include separate Kubernetes YAML manifests for both the WordPress application and the MySQL database, with containers named 'wordpress' and 'mysql' respectively. Consider multi-tier architecture to enhance performance, implement persistent storage solutions, and define resource allocation for optimal load balancing. Additionally, prepare for potential failure scenarios by integrating redundancy and backup mechanisms. Reflect on security implications and propose a strategy for secure communications between the WordPress and MySQL components. Finally, document decision-making processes and trade-offs that influence the architecture and configuration choices, exploring how your approach aligns with best practices in cloud-native application design."
