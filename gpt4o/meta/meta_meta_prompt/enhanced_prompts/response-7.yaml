**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable and secure WordPress website utilizing a MySQL database as its backend. Consider the following complex requirements: 

1. The WordPress container, named 'wordpress', must be configured in a way that supports high availability and automatic scaling to handle fluctuating traffic patterns.
2. The MySQL container, named 'mysql', should implement a robust backup strategy and data persistence across potential node failures.
3. Address network security by considering how to isolate the containers into different namespaces and implement strict Network Policies for communication.
4. Explore the use of ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage WordPress configurations and database credentials, emphasizing security practices.
5. Integrate logging and monitoring solutions to provide insight into performance metrics and alerting on anomalies.
6. Reflect on the economic and environmental impacts of the deployment strategy and propose optimizations, balancing costs and resource utilization.

Your solution should demonstrate a clear understanding of the orchestration challenges and present a reasoned approach to overcoming them, drawing insights from best practices in cloud-native architectures."
