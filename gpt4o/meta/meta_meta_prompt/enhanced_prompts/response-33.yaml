**Revised Prompt:** "Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend. Consider the following aspects in your design: 

1. **Resource Allocation and Management:** How will you ensure that both the WordPress and MySQL containers have optimized resource allocations for scalability? What Kubernetes resources (e.g., CPU, memory) will you define, and why?

2. **Networking and Security:** Outline how you will configure secure and efficient networking to allow seamless communication between the WordPress and MySQL pods. Consider network policies and potential security threats.

3. **Data Persistence:** Formulate a strategy for data persistence for the MySQL database. What type of storage solution will you use and how will you handle data redundancy and recovery?

4. **Scalability and Load Management:** How will you configure the Kubernetes deployment to handle varying loads, ensuring reliability and performance? Discuss the use of horizontal pod autoscalers and any load-balancing techniques.

5. **Monitoring and Maintenance:** What tools and practices will you implement to monitor the health of your deployment and perform maintenance tasks? Include considerations for both application-level and infrastructure-level monitoring.

Using these points, create a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest and provide a brief explanation of how each of these elements is addressed in your design."
