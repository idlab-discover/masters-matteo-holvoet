**Revised Prompt:**  

"Develop a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest aimed at deploying a scalable, secure WordPress website using a MySQL database as the backend. Your solution should address the following challenges and considerations: 

1. **Scalability and Performance**: Design the deployment to be dynamically scalable in response to varying loads while ensuring optimal performance. Consider the use of horizontal pod autoscaling and resource limitations.
   
2. **Security and Data Protection**: Implement best practices for securing both the application and database, including secrets management for sensitive data like database credentials. Consider network policies, security contexts, and encryption at rest and in transit.

3. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**: Ensure the architecture accommodates failure scenarios, retaining functionality during downtime or partial failures by employing multi-zone deployments and persistent storage solutions.

4. **Environment Configuration and Management**: Facilitate environment setup and management from development through to production while allowing for different configurations across environments. Explore the use of config maps and helm charts for templating.

5. **Monitoring and Observability**: Integrate robust monitoring and logging solutions that provide insights into application health, performance metrics, and errors to enable proactive troubleshooting.

6. **Cost-effectiveness**: Balance the architecture for cost-efficiency while meeting the aforementioned requirements. Consider using node affinity/anti-affinity and pod priority and preemption policies.

Provide a detailed reasoning process behind each architecture decision, demonstrating how you synthesized information from cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, and security domains to devise a holistic solution that challenges conventional deployments."
