**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend, considering best practices for security, scalability, and reliability. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. As part of this task, address the following:

1. Security: Outline the steps you would take to ensure the MySQL database is secure from unauthorized access, including network policies and secret management.
2. Scalability: Propose a strategy for scaling the WordPress deployment to handle increasing traffic loads while maintaining performance. Consider the use of Kubernetes resources like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
3. Reliability: Suggest measures to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for both the WordPress and MySQL components, including the use of persistent storage volumes and backup strategies.
4. Cross-functional Integration: Analyze how this deployment can integrate with other components like content delivery networks (CDNs) and monitoring tools for a comprehensive web service solution.
5. Challenge the Norm: Discuss alternative approaches or technologies that could be used instead of Kubernetes for deploying a web application with a database backend, and the potential trade-offs of these alternatives.

By completing this exercise, demonstrate your ability to synthesize information across security, scalability, and reliability domains, while exploring unconventional solutions that could meet the application's deployment needs."
