**Revised Prompt:**

"Develop a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a scalable WordPress website with a MySQL backend database, ensuring best practices for security, resiliency, and performance are incorporated. Consider the following critical elements: 

1. How would you design the WordPress and MySQL deployment to ensure high availability and fault tolerance? 
2. What measures would you incorporate to secure the WordPress and MySQL containers from potential vulnerabilities?
3. How would you optimize resource allocation and manage load balancing for handling varying traffic to the WordPress site? 
4. Consider the implications of potential data breaches; how would you ensure data redundancy and backup strategies?
5. Discuss how you can make use of ConfigMaps and Secrets in your deployment strategy to manage application configurations and sensitive data.
6. Include considerations for automatically scaling the application based on traffic and resource usage, explaining the decision-making process behind your choices.

Additionally, challenge conventional deployment methods by proposing an alternative architecture for a WordPress application that could offer advantages over the traditional MySQL backend." 

This revised prompt encourages a multi-dimensional approach, requiring deep analysis and integration of various Kubernetes functionalities while also challenging users to think creatively and propose innovative solutions.
