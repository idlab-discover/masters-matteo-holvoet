**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest that not only deploys a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend but also considers resilience, security, and scalability. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Furthermore, address the following complexities: 

1. Propose strategies for ensuring high availability of the WordPress application and MySQL database, considering potential node failures within the Kubernetes cluster.
2. Devise a plan to secure data both at rest and in transit, including configuring secrets management and network policies.
3. Explore scalable architectures that can handle varying loads, discussing horizontal and vertical scaling considerations for both containers.
4. Evaluate the implications of using persistent storage for the MySQL database and how it affects data durability and recovery.
5. Consider cost-effective deployment strategies, possibly leveraging cloud-native features that optimize resource utilization.

By integrating these elements, aim to create a comprehensive and robust deployment strategy that ensures the WordPress site is reliable, secure, and scalable, taking into account diverse operational scenarios and constraints."
