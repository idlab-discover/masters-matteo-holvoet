**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a Kubernetes deployment strategy for a high-availability WordPress website using a MySQL database as the backend. Start by creating a detailed YAML manifest that not only names the WordPress container "wordpress" and the MySQL container "mysql" but also ensures scalability, load balancing, and disaster recovery. Consider the following challenges: 

- Implement a mechanism for data persistence and backup for the MySQL database to prevent data loss.
- Devise a network policy to manage traffic and secure communication between the WordPress and MySQL containers.
- Explore strategies to optimize resource utilization and cost efficiency while maintaining performance.
- Propose solutions for monitoring and logging to track system health and preemptively address potential failures.
- Reflect on the implications of this deployment on user experience and business continuity in the event of component failure.

In your solution, analyze the necessity of each component, weigh the benefits and drawbacks of different Kubernetes features, and provide a comprehensive reasoning for the choices made. Additionally, explore how alternative technologies or design patterns could impact your deployment strategy."
