**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a robust WordPress website utilizing a MySQL database as its backend. In this context, assume you're operating within a cloud environment with specific resource limitations and security compliance requirements. The WordPress container should be named 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Consider the following challenges and integrate solutions:

1. Evaluate and implement strategies to ensure high availability and scalability of the WordPress application under varying load conditions.
2. Design a secure configuration that addresses potential vulnerabilities in network access and data encryption between the WordPress and MySQL containers.
3. Incorporate resource efficiency measures that align with the cloud providerâ€™s restrictions while maintaining optimal performance.
4. Propose a disaster recovery plan to minimize downtime and data loss in case of a system failure.
5. Assess and include monitoring and logging mechanisms to proactively manage application health and performance.

Through this task, demonstrate your ability to synthesize knowledge from fields such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, and DevOps best practices, fostering innovative and multifaceted problem-solving approaches."
