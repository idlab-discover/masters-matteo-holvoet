**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a robust and scalable WordPress website with a MySQL database serving as the backend. Consider the following advanced requirements and constraints:

1. Ensure high availability by deploying both WordPress and MySQL in a multi-replica setup with resilient failover strategies. What Kubernetes features will you leverage to achieve this?

2. Optimize system performance and database query efficiency. How will you configure resource limits and requests to cater to varying loads while minimizing costs?

3. Implement secure data storage and transmission practices, including encrypted data management and communication channels. Which Kubernetes security features will you use to enforce these practices?

4. Imagine a scenario where traffic spikes unpredictably. Devise an autoscaling strategy that anticipates rapid workload changes and minimizes latency. Which tools and configurations will support this scenario?

5. Provide a strategy for managing the lifecycle of the application, including version updates and data migrations. How can you ensure seamless updates without disrupting user experience?

Analyze the interconnected challenges and create a detailed plan that addresses these goals, considering current best practices and innovative solutions. This exercise requires synthesizing knowledge from cloud infrastructure management, container orchestration principles, network security, and performance optimization."
