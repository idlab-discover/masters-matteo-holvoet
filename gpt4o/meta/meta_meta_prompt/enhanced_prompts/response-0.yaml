- Incorporate a reliable data backup strategy for the MySQL database to maintain data integrity in the event of a failure.
- Explore security measures to protect the data and prevent unauthorized access, considering both internal and external threats.
- Address potential challenges in networking and service discovery that may arise in a multi-cluster environment.
- Evaluate and incorporate best practices for resource allocation to optimize performance and cost efficiency.
Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Reflect on how different configurations might impact overall application performance and user experience."
