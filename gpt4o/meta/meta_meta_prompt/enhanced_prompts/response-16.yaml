**Revised Prompt:**

"Develop a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable WordPress website, backed by a MySQL database, while ensuring high availability and data persistence. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. As you construct the manifest, consider the following:

1. Evaluate potential scaling issues for both WordPress and MySQL, and implement strategies to address these, such as horizontal pod autoscaling and resource requests/limits.
2. Design a persistent storage solution that ensures data integrity and durability for the MySQL database, taking into account storage replication and backup strategies.
3. Assess and incorporate network policies to secure and manage traffic between WordPress and MySQL, and explore best practices for exposure to external traffic, such as using Ingress controllers.
4. Analyze the implication of using environment variables and ConfigMaps for configuration management, focusing on separation of sensitive and non-sensitive data.
5. Investigate how Kubernetes Secrets can be utilized to securely manage database credentials and other sensitive information, discussing trade-offs and advantages.

Through this exercise, reflect on the interaction between application components and the Kubernetes ecosystem, applying best practices and innovative thinking to improve the overall reliability and security of the deployment."
