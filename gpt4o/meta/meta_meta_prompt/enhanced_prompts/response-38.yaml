Revised Prompt:

"Design a robust Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a highly-available WordPress website with a scalable MySQL backend. In this scenario, consider factors such as load balancing, data persistence, security, and resource optimization. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Explore the following elements in your solution:

1. How would you ensure the WordPress site remains available during MySQL maintenance or unexpected downtime? Consider using multiple MySQL replicas or a managed database service.

2. Identify approach methods for securing data at rest and in transit for both WordPress and MySQL components.

3. Discuss how your configuration can efficiently manage traffic spikes, ensuring both performance and cost-effectiveness. 

4. Account for data persistence challenges and explore strategies for backup, recovery, and consistency across distributed systems.

5. Investigate unconventional approaches or cutting-edge techniques that may improve resource usage or service availability.

Your comprehensive solution should not only deploy WordPress with MySQL but also address these critical aspects to ensure a resilient and efficient system."
