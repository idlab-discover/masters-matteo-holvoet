Revised Prompt: 

"Develop a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a robust, scalable WordPress website that securely connects to a MySQL database as its backend. In this task, incorporate the following complex problem-solving elements:

1. Design considerations for ensuring high availability and fault tolerance for both the WordPress and MySQL components.
2. Evaluate and integrate optimal resource allocation strategies to balance performance with cost-effectiveness.
3. Implement security measures to safeguard data transmission between the WordPress and MySQL containers, considering both network policies and secret management.
4. Explore options for efficient data backup and recovery mechanisms for the MySQL database.
5. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql', and justify your naming conventions within the context of best practices in containerized environments.

Through this task, aim to stimulate critical analysis and synthesis of information from cloud-native infrastructure, security paradigms, and database management domains, while challenging conventional deployment strategies to foster innovation."
