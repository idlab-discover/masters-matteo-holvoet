Revised Prompt: 

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a robust WordPress website with a MySQL database as the backend. Engage in a multi-layered problem-solving approach by considering the following:

1. Ensure the WordPress container, named 'wordpress', and the MySQL container, named 'mysql', are optimized for resource usage, scalability, and resilience.
2. Explore how to securely manage sensitive data like database credentials and API keys using Kubernetes best practices for secrets management.
3. Devise a strategy for ensuring high availability and load balancing across multiple containers, taking into account potential network failures or node outages.
4. Incorporate a persistent storage solution for MySQL data that accounts for data consistency and redundancy.
5. Assess potential security vulnerabilities in container configurations and describe measures to mitigate these risks.
6. Discuss how to monitor and log both containers to aid in performance tuning and incident response.

Your solution should reflect a synthesis of best practices in Kubernetes provisioning, security protocols, and application performance management. Consider the implications of each decision on the system's overall architecture and its ability to scale sustainably."
