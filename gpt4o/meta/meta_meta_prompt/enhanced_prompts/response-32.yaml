**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes deployment strategy for a WordPress website with a MySQL backend. Your solution should include:

1. Developing a YAML manifest that defines resource requests and limits for both the 'wordpress' and 'mysql' containers to ensure optimal performance under varying load conditions.
2. Implementing a persistent storage solution that retains MySQL data and WordPress content during container restarts and failures.
3. Ensuring high availability and scalability by integrating automatic horizontal pod scaling based on specific metrics.
4. Incorporating security best practices, such as secrets management for database credentials and network policies to restrict access between the application and database layers.
5. Describing potential challenges that might arise from this deployment strategy, along with mitigation plans.
6. Analyzing how different Kubernetes features, such as ConfigMaps and StatefulSets, can enhance the functionality and resilience of the deployment.

Evaluate the environmental and infrastructural factors that could impact your design decisions, and propose adjustments for different cloud providers or on-premise setups. Consider the implications of using alternative databases or content management systems and provide a reasoned assessment of the trade-offs involved."
