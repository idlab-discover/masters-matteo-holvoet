Revised Prompt:

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a resilient and scalable WordPress website, utilizing a MySQL database backend. As you undertake this task, consider capacity planning, security best practices, and fault tolerance. Specifically, name the WordPress container as 'wordpress' and the MySQL container as 'mysql'. Additionally, address the following challenges: 

1. Optimize the deployment for high traffic scenarios while minimizing resource consumption. 
2. Implement security measures to safeguard the data in transit and at rest, ensuring compliance with industry standards.
3. Establish a backup and disaster recovery plan to maintain data integrity and availability in case of system failure.
4. Analyze trade-offs between different storage solutions for MySQL, considering factors such as cost, performance, and scalability.
5. Discuss how you would incorporate continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices to update the infrastructure efficiently without downtime.

In your solution, synthesize information from domains such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, and software engineering principles to create an effective and forward-thinking deployment strategy for a production-grade environment."
