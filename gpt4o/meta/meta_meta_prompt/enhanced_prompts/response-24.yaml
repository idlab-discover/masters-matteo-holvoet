**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable WordPress website utilizing a robust MySQL database as its backend. Begin by evaluating optimal configurations for both the WordPress and MySQL containers, considering security, performance, and resource efficiency. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. For added complexity, consider how to implement horizontal scaling for the WordPress application without causing database bottlenecks. Contemplate the integration of persistent storage solutions to maintain data integrity across potential container restarts. Additionally, factor in best practices for network policies to safeguard sensitive data traffic between the WordPress and MySQL containers. In your configuration, incorporate strategies for monitoring and logging, and propose a disaster recovery plan to ensure service continuity under failure scenarios. How might you synthesize this setup to accommodate potential future expansions of the service?"
