**Revised Prompt:**

"Develop a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest that orchestrates the deployment of a WordPress website utilizing a MySQL database as its backend. Within this deployment, ensure to name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Your task should incorporate not only the basic deployment configurations but also advanced features that enhance reliability and scalability. 

Consider the following aspects:

1. Design a fault-tolerant architecture that mitigates potential single points of failure for both the WordPress and MySQL components. Think beyond conventional methods to implement redundancy and failover.

2. Explore and apply advanced networking concepts, such as service discovery and load balancing, to ensure efficient traffic management between WordPress and MySQL pods.

3. Develop a strategy to handle persistent data storage for MySQL, ensuring data security and integrity across potential container relaunches.

4. Integrate security considerations such as secrets management for database credentials and secure communication between pods.

5. Evaluate and implement appropriate resource requests and limits, taking into account the potential for scaling the WordPress site under varying loads.

6. Provide insights into monitoring and logging mechanisms that can track the health and performance of both WordPress and MySQL services, facilitating timely issue detection and resolution.

Synthesize information from Kubernetes best practices and cloud-native architecture approaches to build a robust solution that can evolve with changing demands and technologies."
