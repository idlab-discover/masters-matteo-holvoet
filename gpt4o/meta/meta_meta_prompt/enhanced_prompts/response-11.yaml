**Revised Prompt:**

"Design a robust Kubernetes YAML manifest that deploys a highly available WordPress website with a MySQL backend. Consider the following multi-faceted challenges: ensure zero downtime updates, incorporate resource efficiency by using persistent storage solutions, and enhance scalability to handle varying user loads. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. In your design, critically evaluate the trade-offs between utilizing StatefulSets versus Deployments for the database management, and explore different methods to secure data transmission between WordPress and MySQL. Additionally, propose strategies to monitor and auto-scale your application based on real-time traffic analysis. Aim for a solution that not only delivers performance and reliability but also adopts best practices in cloud-native architecture."
