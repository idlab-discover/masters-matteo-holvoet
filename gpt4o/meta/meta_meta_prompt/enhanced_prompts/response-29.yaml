Revised Prompt:

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a resilient WordPress website backed by a MySQL database. Consider incorporating best practices for security, high availability, and scalability. Designate the WordPress container as 'wordpress' and the MySQL container as 'mysql'. As you construct the manifest, consider the following:

- How would you configure persistent storage to ensure data integrity and reliability in case of node failures?
- What security measures will you implement to protect both WordPress and MySQL containers, especially in terms of access control and data encryption?
- How would you architect the deployment to ensure scalability and manage performance under varying loads?
- Explore how you can leverage Kubernetes features like ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration effectively.
- Propose a strategy to monitor and log the application behavior, focusing on both operational insights and troubleshooting needs.
- Consider potential pitfalls that might arise from deploying these services in a production environment and how you would mitigate them.

Through this exercise, delve into the multi-faceted aspects of deploying containerized applications in Kubernetes, synthesizing knowledge from infrastructure management, security, and application performance optimization."
