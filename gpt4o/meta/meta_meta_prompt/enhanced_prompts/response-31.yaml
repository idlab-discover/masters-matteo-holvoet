Revised Prompt:

"Design a Kubernetes YAML manifest for a complete WordPress website deployment, using a MySQL database for backend operations. The challenge involves configuring the WordPress container as 'wordpress' and the MySQL container as 'mysql', while ensuring best practices for scalability, security, and data integrity in a production environment. As part of your task, address the following considerations: 

1. Implement persistent storage solutions for data resilience and continuity in case of a pod failure or restart.
2. Configure network policies to ensure secure communication between the WordPress and MySQL containers, while minimizing exposure to external threats.
3. Analyze and apply resource limits and requests to optimize the performance of both containers under variable loads.
4. Develop a strategy to handle database migrations and WordPress updates seamlessly, minimizing downtime and maintaining user experience.
5. Explore potential failure scenarios and design contingency plans, such as automated backups and rollback procedures, to maintain service reliability.

Your approach should integrate insights from cloud architecture, cybersecurity, database management, and operational best practices to create a robust and efficient deployment strategy."
