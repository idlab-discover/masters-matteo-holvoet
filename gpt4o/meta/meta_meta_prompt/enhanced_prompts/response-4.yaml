"[Revised Prompt]

Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a scalable WordPress website with a resilient MySQL backend. The solution should consider high availability, load balancing, and data persistence. Name the WordPress container "wordpress" and the MySQL container "mysql". As you develop the manifest, analyze and address the following considerations:

1. Scalability: How will you configure horizontal scaling for the WordPress deployment to handle varying traffic loads?
2. High Availability: What strategies will you implement to ensure both WordPress and MySQL components remain available during server failures or maintenance?
3. Data Persistence: Devise a solution for persistent storage that ensures MySQL data durability across pod restarts and scaling operations.
4. Security: Identify potential security vulnerabilities and propose measures to protect both WordPress and MySQL instances.
5. Network Configuration: How will you configure networking resources (like Services, Ingress, etc.) to optimize communication and user access while mitigating latency issues?
6. Resource Optimization: Suggest methods for resource allocation that ensure efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Through this exercise, synthesize knowledge of Kubernetes architecture, database management, and web application deployment to produce a robust, scalable web service infrastructure."

This revised prompt incorporates multi-step reasoning, encourages complex problem-solving, and prompts to analyze different layers of a Kubernetes deployment. It challenges the conventional setup process by considering multiple aspects such as scalability, availability, and security, while also promoting a holistic understanding of system interactions and resource management.
