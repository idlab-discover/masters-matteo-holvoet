**Revised Prompt:**

"Develop a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a resilient and scalable WordPress website architecture utilizing a MySQL database as the backend. Consider the following aspects for a robust deployment: 

1. **Container Configuration**: Name the primary WordPress container 'wordpress' and the database container 'mysql'. Deploy these containers within their respective Pods.

2. **Fault Tolerance and High Availability**: How would you structure the deployment to ensure continuous availability and failover capabilities for both WordPress and MySQL?

3. **Data Persistence and Backup**: Propose a strategy for maintaining data integrity and persistence through Kubernetes Persistent Volumes, and discuss backup mechanisms to prevent data loss.

4. **Network Policies and Security**: Define network policies to secure the communication between the WordPress and MySQL components. What security measures would you implement to safeguard data and application layers from potential threats?

5. **Scalability and Load Balancing**: Suggest an approach to accommodate increased traffic load dynamically. Explain how you would employ Horizontal Pod Autoscaling or other Kubernetes-native solutions for balanced scaling.

6. **Resource Management**: Specify resource requests and limits for CPU and memory, justifying the allocation to ensure optimal performance without over-provisioning.

Encourage innovative thinking by challenging traditional deployment assumptions to provide a well-rounded and sustainable solution. Explore the implications of your choices across these dimensions, integrating insights from cloud architecture, DevOps best practices, and information security domains."
