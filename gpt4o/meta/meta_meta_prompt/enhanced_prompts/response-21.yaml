Revised Prompt:

"Design a comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifest to deploy a WordPress website with a MySQL database backend, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance. Name the WordPress container 'wordpress' and the MySQL container 'mysql'. Consider the following requirements and challenges: 

- Integrate persistent storage for the database to ensure data durability and recovery.
- Implement resource limits and requests for both containers to optimize performance.
- Plan for the high availability of the WordPress application, detailing how you would handle potential node failures.
- Develop strategies for effective traffic management and load balancing in a multi-node environment.
- Explore diverse security measures to protect both the application and database from unauthorized access.
- Analyze the implications of this setup in terms of cloud resource utilization and cost efficiency.

By addressing these elements, craft a solution that not only meets the immediate deployment needs but also accommodates future growth and unexpected disruptions."
