To create a Kubernetes YAML manifest for deploying a WordPress website using a MySQL database as the backend, we'll break down the process into several key steps. This will ensure that both the WordPress and MySQL deployments are properly configured.

### Step 1: Define Persistent Volumes and Claims
To maintain data persistence, we'll first define Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for both WordPress and MySQL.

### Step 2: Configure MySQL Deployment and Service
We'll set up a Deployment for MySQL, as well as a Service for internal communication.

### Step 3: Configure WordPress Deployment and Service
Next, we'll set up a Deployment for WordPress and a Service to expose it.

### Step 4: YAML Manifest Compilation
We'll compile all these components into a single YAML manifest file.

Let's start by writing the Kubernetes YAML manifest:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: mysql:5.7
        name: mysql
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: your_password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: wordpress:latest
        name: wordpress
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql:3306
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: your_password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pv-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

### Explanation:
- **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):** 
  - We define PVCs for both MySQL and WordPress to ensure we have persistent storage and data is not lost if pods are restarted.

- **MySQL Deployment and Service:**
  - MySQL deployment specifies a container using the `mysql:5.7` image with necessary environment variables for the initial database setup.
  - We create a headless Service (clusterIP: None) to allow internal traffic between WordPress and MySQL.

- **WordPress Deployment and Service:**
  - The WordPress deployment uses the `wordpress:latest` image and connects to the MySQL database via the Service.
  - A LoadBalancer Service is created for WordPress to expose it to the external world. This assumes that your Kubernetes setup supports LoadBalancer services.

### Important:
- Replace `your_password` in both MySQL and WordPress configuration with a secure password of your choice.
- Ensure your Kubernetes environment supports LoadBalancers, or modify the service type if necessary.

Once the manifest is ready, apply it using `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml` to deploy WordPress with MySQL.
