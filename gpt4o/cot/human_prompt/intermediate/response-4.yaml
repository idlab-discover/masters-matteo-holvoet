To deploy a WordPress website using a MySQL database backend in Kubernetes, we'll need to define a number of resources in a YAML manifest. The primary components include:

1. **PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim**: For both WordPress and MySQL to store persistent data.
2. **Secret**: To store sensitive data such as the MySQL root password.
3. **ConfigMap**: For non-sensitive configurations.
4. **Deployment**: To define the pods for both WordPress and MySQL.
5. **Service**: To expose the WordPress application and allow the WordPress container to communicate with the MySQL container.

We'll go through each step and combine everything in a single manifest:

### Step 1: Define Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims

We'll define persistent volume claims for MySQL and WordPress to store data:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

### Step 2: Define Secrets

We'll create a secret to store the MySQL database password securely:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-pass
type: Opaque
data:
  password: bXlzcWxfcGFzc3dvcmQ= # This is "mysql_password" base64 encoded
```

### Step 3: Define Deployments

We'll define deployments for the MySQL and WordPress containers.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: mysql:5.7
        name: mysql
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: wordpress:latest
        name: wordpress
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-pass
              key: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: wordpress
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
      - name: wordpress-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: wordpress-pvc
```

### Step 4: Define Services

Finally, we'll define services for MySQL and WordPress.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None # Ensures the DB is only reachable within the cluster
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

### Conclusion

The above YAML manifest sets up a basic WordPress application connected to a MySQL database on Kubernetes. It uses persistent volume claims to ensure data persistence, secrets to manage sensitive information, and services to expose and connect the components. Adjust storage sizes, Kubernetes network types, or advanced configurations, such as specific ingress rules or custom resource limits, as needed for your environment.
