### Expert Reflections:

**Expert 1**: Initially, we need to consider the WordPress and MySQL images and their configurations. We start by setting up the WordPress deployment first. The `env` fields are crucial; they establish a connection between WordPress and MySQL by providing the database host, user, and password. We create a service for WordPress with a LoadBalancer type for external access.

**Expert 2**: That's a solid start, I like how you've set up the WordPress deployment. However, let's not forget that MySQL needs to be a StatefulSet if we want persistent storage, which can be enhanced later. But for simplicity, let's continue with the deployment. Also, using `clusterIP: None` on MySQL ensures it's accessible within the cluster as a headless service, allowing proper DNS resolution.

**Expert 3**: Both great observations. The use of `env` variables effectively connects WordPress to MySQL. Later, we can enhance these manifests with persistent volumes for real-world applications. For now, using Kubernetes secrets for passwords could be another improvement to ensure better security practices. Good teamwork on refining these deployments.
