Expert 1: Alright, folks, when we're deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend on Kubernetes, we'll need to create a few different resources: a Deployment for both WordPress and MySQL, and Services for both to manage their networking. I'll start with the Deployment for WordPress. Since WordPress needs to connect to MySQL, I'll ensure that we specify the appropriate environment variables to connect to it. 

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: example-password
```

Expert 2: That's a great start! Thanks for getting us rolling. I'll take on the MySQL Deployment next. It's crucial to ensure the MySQL container is configured securely, so I'll set a root password as an environment variable. Also, since WordPress needs persistent storage to keep its database intact, I'll add a PersistentVolumeClaim to the MySQL Deployment.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: example-password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
```

Expert 3: Excellent contributions, guys. We've covered the Deployments nicely, and I appreciate the focus on persistence and security as well. Now, let's focus on the Services to expose WordPress and MySQL deployments: WordPress will generally need to be accessible from outside the cluster, so I'll set its Service type as LoadBalancer, whereas MySQL will be a ClusterIP since it's only needed within the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```

Expert 1: Great job integrating persistence and the right exposure level for the services. I appreciate the focus on keeping MySQL internal and ensuring WordPress is externally reachable. Letâ€™s make sure that the deployment is completed by using the right labels in selectors and ensuring our components can find each other seamlessly. 

All Experts: Let's combine these segments into one coherent manifest. The YAML below encapsulates all we've discussed and ensures each service and deployment is properly configured to meet the deployment requirements.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: root
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: example-password
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: example-password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```

With all components considered, this manifest efficiently establishes a WordPress site backed by MySQL on Kubernetes.
