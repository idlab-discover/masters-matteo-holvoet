### Expert 1: Initialization and Volumes

"To begin tackling the deployment of a WordPress website using MySQL as the backend, our first task is to identify that we'll need two primary components: WordPress and MySQL. We'll structure them within a `Deployment` for scalable management and use `PersistentVolumes` and `PersistentVolumeClaims` for persistent storage.

Let's start with the MySQL part. MySQL requires persistent data storage for the database files. We'll declare a `PersistentVolume` and a `PersistentVolumeClaim` for data persistence. Recognizing that WordPress will also need persistent storage for its files, we'll do the same for WordPress shortly.

Here's how we could start for the MySQL setup:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data/mysql"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
```

This setup allocates 1Gi storage to MySQL within the cluster on path `/mnt/data/mysql`. Now, letâ€™s proceed with the MySQL deployment details."

### Expert 2: Deployment Component

"Excellent start. Building on Expert 1's persistence layer, I'll define the `Deployment` for MySQL. It's crucial we specify environment variables, such as `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, which will be used by the MySQL image for the database setup. Security wise, we will use Kubernetes Secrets instead for better security in a real-world scenario.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:5.7
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: mypassword
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3306
          volumeMounts:
            - name: mysql-storage
              mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
        - name: mysql-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```

This deployment specifies a MySQL pod configuration for container image `mysql:5.7`, exposing the default MySQL port `3306`, and mounts the persistent volume. Now, let's move to WordPress."

### Expert 3: WordPress Deployment and Service Connectivity

"I commend the groundwork laid by my colleagues. With the MySQL backend setup almost complete, it's now time to focus our attention on WordPress itself. We'll need another `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` to persist WordPress data.

Here is how the WordPress storage configuration might appear:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data/wordpress"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: wordpress-pv-claim
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
```

Now, let's focus on deploying WordPress and hooking it up with MySQL. We'll also need to expose WordPress via a Service.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          env:
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
              value: mysql
            - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
              value: mypassword
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          volumeMounts:
            - name: wordpress-storage
              mountPath: /var/www/html
      volumes:
        - name: wordpress-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: wordpress-pv-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

This configuration deploys a WordPress container using the official WordPress image, accessible on port 80. It connects to the MySQL service using the environment variable `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST`, ensuring the two services communicate correctly. We used `NodePort`, but LoadBalancer can be chosen depending on the environment.

Together, these manifest definitions establish a complete and robust deployment architecture for WordPress with MySQL on Kubernetes. Thanks to the contributions from my peers, we have a coherent and interconnected setup that can now be fully submitted to a Kubernetes cluster for deployment."
