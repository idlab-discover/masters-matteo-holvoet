### Expert 1's Explanation:
Alright, let's start constructing the needed Kubernetes YAML manifests. For deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend, we'll need at least two Deployments and two Services to allow for internal communication. I'll first outline the basics:

1. **MySQL Deployment:** We'll create a Deployment for the MySQL database. We need to set the environment variables required for the database to run—MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_USER, and MYSQL_PASSWORD.

2. **WordPress Deployment:** This Deployment will reference the MySQL database using environment variables for the WordPress installation.

Let's start with the MySQL Deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: "rootpassword"
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: "wordpress"
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: "wordpress"
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value: "wordpresspassword"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
```

So far, this sets up the MySQL container with essential configurations.

### Expert 2's Refinement:
Great work on the MySQL Deployment! Now, I'll add the Service for MySQL to expose it within the cluster at a specific hostname, making it discoverable internally by the WordPress pod. Also, I'll start the WordPress Deployment.

Here's the MySQL Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None  # For headless service
```

Now, addressing the WordPress Deployment, we need to connect to this MySQL service, so let’s use environment variables to point WordPress to the correct MySQL service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql:3306
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: wordpress
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: wordpresspassword
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Expert 3's Enhancement:
Nice job setting up the Deployments and Services! I’ll ensure a Service for WordPress is also added so it can be accessed externally, improving the manifests with a few best practices, like adding readiness and liveness probes where essential for production robustness.

Here's the WordPress Service to expose it:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

Excellent points overall; this manifest provides a comprehensive setup for deploying WordPress with MySQL on Kubernetes, and the use of separate services ensures modularity and clarity. If needed, we can improve this deployment further by adding persistence using Volumes and PersistentVolumeClaims to keep data across pod restarts.

All components together would look like:

```yaml
# MySQL Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: "rootpassword"
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          value: "wordpress"
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          value: "wordpress"
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          value: "wordpresspassword"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306

# MySQL Service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
  clusterIP: None

# WordPress Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wordpress
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wordpress
        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql:3306
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_USER
          value: wordpress
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: wordpresspassword
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
          value: wordpress
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

---
# WordPress Service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wordpress
```

Each step is integral to the final setup, ensuring the application is functional, discoverable, and externally available where needed.
