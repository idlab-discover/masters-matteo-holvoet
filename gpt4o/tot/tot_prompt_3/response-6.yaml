To create Kubernetes YAML manifests for deploying a WordPress website with a MySQL backend, we have three experts: a Kubernetes Developer, a DevOps Engineer, and a Cloud Architect. Each will provide their thoughts on constructing the solution step by step.

### Step 1: Define Persistent Volumes for MySQL Data Storage

- **Kubernetes Developer:** We'll start by creating a PersistentVolume (PV) and a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for MySQL, to ensure data persistence.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: mysql-pv
  spec:
    capacity:
      storage: 10Gi
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    hostPath:
      path: "/mnt/data/mysql"
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: mysql-pvc
  spec:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
  ```
  - Score for DevOps Engineer: 4
  - Score for Cloud Architect: 4

- **DevOps Engineer:** Agree with creating PV and PVC, but consider using `storageClassName` for dynamically provisioned storage in a cloud environment.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: mysql-pvc
  spec:
    storageClassName: standard
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
  ```
  - Score for Kubernetes Developer: 4
  - Score for Cloud Architect: 5

- **Cloud Architect:** Initial step is crucial for persistence but align it with the underlying storage class on cloud provider platforms.
  - Adapt either approach; using dynamic provisioning is a structured approach for cloud deployments.
  - Score for Kubernetes Developer: 4
  - Score for DevOps Engineer: 5

### Step 2: Create the MySQL Deployment and Service

- **Kubernetes Developer:** Define a Deployment for MySQL with references to the PVC and environment variables for database configuration.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: mysql
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: mysql
    replicas: 1
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: mysql
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:5.7
          env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            value: examplePassword
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
            name: mysql-storage
        volumes:
        - name: mysql-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: mysql-pvc
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: mysql
  spec:
    ports:
      - port: 3306
    selector:
      app: mysql
  ```
  - Score for DevOps Engineer: 5
  - Score for Cloud Architect: 5

- **DevOps Engineer:** Emphasize the need to ensure the correct security settings for MySQL passwords and sensitive information.
  - Agree with approach, recommend secret management later.
  - Score for Kubernetes Developer: 5
  - Score for Cloud Architect: 5

- **Cloud Architect:** Focus on scalability; design such that if future database scaling is needed, it's easily manageable.
  - Current deployment suits small projects.
  - Score for Kubernetes Developer: 5
  - Score for DevOps Engineer: 5

### Step 3: Define the WordPress Deployment and Service

- **Kubernetes Developer:** WordPress should be defined in a similar deployment format, connecting to the MySQL service.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: wordpress
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: wordpress
    replicas: 1
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: wordpress
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:latest
          env:
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
            value: mysql:3306
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
            value: examplePassword
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: wordpress
  spec:
    type: LoadBalancer
    ports:
      - port: 80
    selector:
      app: wordpress
  ```
  - Score for DevOps Engineer: 5
  - Score for Cloud Architect: 5

- **DevOps Engineer:** Indicate using Ingress for enhanced HTTP handling, but as a base example, this will work.
  - Consider integrating secrets to manage database connections securely.
  - Score for Kubernetes Developer: 5
  - Score for Cloud Architect: 5

- **Cloud Architect:** For scalability and high availability, include replica sets, and ensure the load balancer is correctly set up based on the provider.
  - For demonstration purposes, the approach is sound.
  - Score for Kubernetes Developer: 5
  - Score for DevOps Engineer: 5

### Consensus Solution

All experts agree on the basic structure of the deployment. The focus is on persistence, secure configuration, and visibility. Secrets management for database credentials is suggested for production environments, while the use of `LoadBalancer` type services simplifies external access to WordPress.

Below is the consolidated Kubernetes YAML manifest:

```yaml
# Persistent Volume Claim for MySQL
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: standard
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
---
# MySQL Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: examplePassword
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
          name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pvc
---

  ports:
    - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
---
# WordPress Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

        image: wordpress:latest
        env:
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
          value: mysql:3306
        - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
          value: examplePassword

```

This manifest provides a strong foundation following Kubernetes best practices, and consideration for environment-specific adjustments, such as security management and accessing services, was also considered.
