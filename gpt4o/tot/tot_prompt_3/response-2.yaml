Expert 1: Kubernetes Developer

Step 1: Identify Resources Needed 
Thinking: We need to create two main components: a Deployment for the WordPress application and a Deployment for the MySQL database, along with the necessary Services to expose them. Additionally, we'll need Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for persistent storage.
Score: 5 

Step 2: Create Persistent Volume Claims
Thinking: The WordPress and MySQL deployments will each need a PVC to store application and database data persistently.
Score: 5 

Step 3: Define MySQL Deployment and Service
Thinking: The MySQL Deployment should use an official MySQL image, with environment variables to set the database credentials. Create a Service to expose the database internally.
Score: 5 

Step 4: Define WordPress Deployment and Service
Thinking: The WordPress Deployment should use an official WordPress image, configured via environment variables to connect to the MySQL database using the Service name as the hostname. Create a Service to expose WordPress externally.
Score: 5 

Expert 2: Database Administrator

Step 1: Plan Database Resource Requirements
Thinking: Ensure the MySQL container has sufficient resources and is deployed with proper configuration for security and persistence.
Score: 5

Step 2: Define Database Configuration
Thinking: Set up environment variables in the MySQL deployment for database name, user, and password. Use a generated secret or config map for managing sensitive information.
Score: 4.5

Step 3: Ensure Persistence
Thinking: Create a Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim to ensure MySQL data persists across pod restarts or redeployments.
Score: 5

Step 4: Validate Connectivity
Thinking: Confirm WordPress can successfully connect to MySQL and that the database is correctly initialized.
Score: 5

Expert 3: Cloud Solutions Architect

Step 1: Define Overall Architecture
Thinking: Consider network policies, storage, and scalability to ensure the WordPress and MySQL components are efficiently orchestrated within Kubernetes.
Score: 5

Step 2: Configure Security and Secrets
Thinking: Implement Secrets for database credentials to enhance security. Also consider Network Policies for securing communication.
Score: 5

Step 3: Set Up Deployment Strategies
Thinking: Adopt rolling updates and specify resource requests and limits for both WordPress and MySQL Deployments.
Score: 5

Step 4: Ensure Load Balancing and Exposure
Thinking: Use appropriate Service types, such as ClusterIP for MySQL and LoadBalancer for WordPress, to ensure proper exposure and load balancing.
Score: 5

Consensus Solution:
Based on the combined expertise, a Kubernetes manifest would include PVCs for each deployment to ensure data persistence, Deployments with resource requests/limits, Secrets to handle sensitive data securely, and Services with appropriate configurations for exposure. The MySQL deployment would require environment variables for configuration, while WordPress needs to reference the MySQL service for database connectivity. Here's a combined manifest encompassing these insights:
