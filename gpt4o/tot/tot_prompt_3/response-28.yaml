To answer your request, I am going to present the steps and thoughts of three different experts who are familiar with Kubernetes and the deployment of WordPress applications using a MySQL backend. They will collaboratively develop a Kubernetes YAML manifest while providing their reasoning. 

### Step 1: Define the Deployment for MySQL

**Expert 1: Kubernetes Developer**
- Thinking: We'll start with the backend because WordPress requires a database to be set up first. We'll define a `Deployment` for MySQL.
- YAML Snippet: 
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: mysql
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: mysql
    replicas: 1
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: mysql
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: mysql
          image: mysql:5.7
          env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            value: example
  ```

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 2: Database Administrator**
- Thinking: I agree to start with the backend, and it's important to include initialization variables for MySQL.
- Suggestion: Use a ConfigMap for scalable environments to store such configurations.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 3: DevOps Engineer**
- Thinking: Proper deployment demands using Kubernetes Secrets for MySQL passwords for security reasons. 
- Suggestion: Adapt the secret configuration in the next iteration.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

### Step 2: Define the Secret for MySQL Credentials

**Expert 1: Kubernetes Developer**
- Thinking: Enhancing security by storing sensitive data like passwords in a `Secret`. 
- YAML Snippet:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: mysql-pass
  type: Opaque
  data:
    password: ZXhhbXBsZQ==  # base64 encoding of 'example'
  ```

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 2: Database Administrator**
- Thinking: Good security practice. Password should be encoded.
- Suggestion: Ensure the environment variable references this secret.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 3: DevOps Engineer**
- Thinking: This is the correct approach for sensitive data.
- Suggestion: Proceed to configure MySQL to consume this secret as an environment variable.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

### Step 3: Configure MySQL Deployment with Secret

**Expert 1: Kubernetes Developer**
- Thinking: Update the MySQL Deployment to utilize the secret.
- Update Deployment:
  ```yaml
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql:5.7
      env:
      - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: mysql-pass
            key: password
  ```

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 2: Database Administrator**
- Thinking: Correct implementation of Secret reference in the Deployment.
- Suggestion: Go ahead with the MySQL service for internal communication.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 3: DevOps Engineer**
- Thinking: Valid approach to utilize the secret.
- Suggestion: Prepare MySQL service for exposure to other services.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

### Step 4: Define MySQL Service

**Expert 1: Kubernetes Developer**
- Thinking: Create a `Service` to expose MySQL internally.
- YAML Snippet:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: mysql
  spec:
    type: ClusterIP
    selector:
      app: mysql
    ports:
    - port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
  ```

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 2: Database Administrator**
- Thinking: Necessary for other applications to communicate with MySQL.
- Suggestion: Next, we deploy WordPress and use this service.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 3: DevOps Engineer**
- Thinking: The Service is configured correctly, allowing cluster-internal communication.
- Suggestion: Proceed to configure WordPress deployment.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

### Step 5: Define WordPress Deployment

**Expert 1: Kubernetes Developer**
- Thinking: Next, create a `Deployment` for WordPress.
- YAML Snippet:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: wordpress
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: wordpress
    replicas: 1
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: wordpress
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: wordpress
          image: wordpress:5.8
          env:
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
            value: mysql
          - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysql-pass
                key: password
  ```

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 2: Database Administrator**
- Thinking: Correctly providing necessary database host information for WordPress.
- Suggestion: Ensure to create a service for WordPress.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 3: DevOps Engineer**
- Thinking: Verify that environmental values point to the correct Services.
- Suggestion: Add service exposure.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

### Step 6: Define WordPress Service

**Expert 1: Kubernetes Developer**
- Thinking: Expose WordPress leveraging a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` service.
- YAML Snippet:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: wordpress
  spec:
    type: NodePort  # Or LoadBalancer in a cloud setting
    selector:
      app: wordpress
    ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  ```

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 2: Database Administrator**
- Thinking: Exposes WordPress correctly to users.
- Suggestion: Finalize testing for connectivity.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5

**Expert 3: DevOps Engineer**
- Thinking: Service is correctly defined for exposure.
- Suggestion: Proceed with testing the entire setup.

Score:
- Score given by peers: 5, 5
